Many structures in the garden - the main gate, garden house, bridges, and shrine - were built in Japan and reassembled here. Antique stone carvings, water basins and lanterns, as well as the five-tiered pagoda, and key symbolic rocks are also from Japan. Several hundred tons of local stones came from the quarries in Ventura County and the foot of Mt. Baldy, northeast of Los Angeles.;                        Main Address:;         Hannah Carter Japanese Garden;         Garden Administrative Office, UCLA;        10920 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 1520;        Los Angeles;        California 90024-6518 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (310) 794-0320;         Fax: (310) 794-8208;         URL: http://hannahcarterjapanesegarden.com/;         Primary Email: info@hannahcarterjapanesegarden.com       ;
