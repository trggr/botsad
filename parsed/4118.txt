The aim is to help small farmers, women and big farmers to begin small projects by applying our research on papaya, prickly pear, cherimoya in cooperation with Dr A Badr, who has done breeding studies using conventional methods (seeds and grafting), and through the use of biotechnology for rapid propagation and distribution of selected and promising varieties.
