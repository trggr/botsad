Thousands of visitors come to the Garden each year to learn about McKee’s rich history and enjoy the natural landscape of majestic palms, exotic plants, trees, waterfalls, tranquil streams, and historic structures.  ;  ;  In addition to the Garden’s horticultural beauty, McKee Botanical Garden is a valued resource for cultural enrichment, hosting a variety of programs each season including world-class art exhibits, educational courses for adults and children, and special events.  ;  ;  McKee Botanical Garden is a private, nonprofit organization whose mission is to nurture and enhance a historic garden in a unique tropical setting for the education, enjoyment and enrichment of all.  ;  ;  McKee has garnered national attention in publications such as Better Homes and Gardens, Coastal Living, House and Garden, Southern Living and The New York Times, and was named one of “22 Secret Gardens – Soothing Places of Surprise and Sanctuary in the U.S. and Canada” by National Geographic Traveler and was recognized as one of the “Top 10 Most Beautiful Gardens That Florida Has To Offer” by TripsToDiscover.com.
