One of the floral highlights of the year is spring, when thousands of annuals and brightly coloured vygies come into flower. This colourful spectacle lasts from mid-August to the end of September. See the seasonal highlights pages.;  ;  A must for succulent lovers, the Garden lies on the outskirts of Worcester, 120 kilometres from Cape Town. See route map for details. Falling within the succulent karoo biome, which includes the Namaqualand flora so famous for its spring flowers, the Garden boasts some 400 naturally occurring species. The garden is also a haven for rare and endangered plants, with over 300 species being protected and propagated. Almost 95 species of birds have been recorded in the Garden, as well as a wide range of small mammals, such as the Cape grey duiker. The garden has an interesting history as can be seen from an article entitled From Whitehill to Worcester that appeared in Veld & Flora in March 2006. ;  ;  Approximately 11 hectares of the estate are cultivated, whilst the remaining 143 are kept as a flora reserve which has several kilometres of nature trails.;                        Main Address:;         Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden;         South African National Biodiversity Institute;        PO Box 152, Worcester 6849;        Worcester;        Western Cape 6850 South Africa;        ;                 Telephone: +27 (0)23 347 0785;         Fax: ;         URL: www.sanbi.org;         Primary Email: r.riddles@sanbi.org.za       ;
