Though many courses in Horticulture, Plant Pathology, Entomology, and Urban Forestry utilize the garden on a weekly basis, this is more than just a place to learn about plants and landscapes, students are actively engaged in garden development and maintenance, construction of new features, and assistance with educational outreach efforts. Our secondary mission is outreach to members of the university, visitors, the New River Valley community, and K-12 students and educators. We provide a dynamic environment, brimming with gardening ideas, cutting edge plants, educational events, and a place for recreation and relaxation.;                        Main Address:;         Hahn Horticulture Garden of Virginia Tech;         Peggy Lee Hahn Garden Pavilion (0915);        200 Garden Lane;        Blacksburg;        Virginia 24061 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (540) 231-5970;         Fax: (540) 231-3083;         URL: www.hort.vt.edu/hhg;         Primary Email: vtgarden@vt.edu       ;
