A botanical garden was not initially planned for the area, but following the plant rescue mission in 1995 and 1996 before the inundation of the Katse reservoir, the garden was created to accommodate the rescued plants.;  ;  With the increasing loss of biodiversity in Lesotho through over-exploitation, the Katse Botanical Garden provides a unique natural and semi-natural setting to expose a wider audience to the floristic beauty of the indigenous plants of Lesotho.;  ;  Katse Botanical Garden strives to promote a better knowledge and understanding of the alpine flora of Lesotho through propagation, cultivation, and conservation of indigenous plants. It serves as an educational centre for local communities, as well as for scientists, students, and the visiting public.;  ;  Contact details that may no longer be valid are:;  Tel: 09266 311280;  Fax: 09266 325038;  Email: ntlokb@lhda.org.ls;                        Main Address:;         Katse Botanic Garden;         P.O.
