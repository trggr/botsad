Through their efforts, the Public Gardens were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1984.;  ;  In true Victorian fashion, the Gardens boast ornate fountains, a bandstand, statues, urns and a magnificent wrought iron entrance. Also among their treasures are over 100 different species of trees, including unusual or rare species and some centenarians. Their serpentine, scroll and carpet beds guarantee a bounty of colour and fragrance throughout the season.;                        Main Address:;         Halifax Public Gardens;         5665 Spring Garden Road;        Mailing: P.O.
