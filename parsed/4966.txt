Originally planted in open fields, the collection has been winnowed by thirty or more winters; while there have been losses, the survivors demonstrate the vast range of hardy trees that can be expected to survive in North Yorkshire.;  ;  The plantings started with a diverse collection of interesting trees purchased in 1979 from Hillier Nurseries, Hampshire, which then offered an extraordinary range of material but was in the process of stream-lining its assortment. This gave the arboretum a core of good plants, many of them now rare in cultivation.;                        Main Address:;         The Yorkshire Arboretum;         Castle Howard;                York;        Yorkshire YO60 7BY United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: +44 (0) 1653-648598;         Fax: +44 (0) 1653 648650;         URL: http://www.yorkshirearboretum.org/;         Primary Email: enquiries@yorkshirearboretum.org       ;
