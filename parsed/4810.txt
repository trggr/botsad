Info:	  United Kingdom - Cheshire - Altrincham  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Dunham Massey Not only one of the plantsman's gardens of the Northwest, but also of considerable historic interest. The moat and mount are early features, later becoming part of a wider formal layout in the 19th-century French style. The exquisite orangery survives and, closer to the house, the Edwardian parterre. Elsewhere, the moist acid conditions and varied site are home to natural plantings of shade- and moisture-loving plants. Highlights include Himalayan blue poppies in spring, giant Chinese lilies and late-flowering azaleas in early summer, followed by mixed borders. Extensive collection of hydrangeas. Paths around spacious lawns and through woodland are wheelchair-friendly.;  Main Address:; Dunham Massey; Altrincham; Cheshire WA14 4SJ United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dunham-massey/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dunham-massey/; Primary Email: ;
