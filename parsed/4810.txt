The moat and mount are early features, later becoming part of a wider formal layout in the 19th-century French style. The exquisite orangery survives and, closer to the house, the Edwardian parterre. Elsewhere, the moist acid conditions and varied site are home to natural plantings of shade- and moisture-loving plants. Highlights include Himalayan blue poppies in spring, giant Chinese lilies and late-flowering azaleas in early summer, followed by mixed borders. Extensive collection of hydrangeas. Paths around spacious lawns and through woodland are wheelchair-friendly.;                        Main Address:;         Dunham Massey;                         Altrincham;        Cheshire WA14 4SJ United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dunham-massey/;         Primary Email:        ;
