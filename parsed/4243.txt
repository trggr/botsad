9-"garden-project" style="margin-top: 1em"> Restoring pasture to rainforest in Ecuador <!-- <img src="/files/ERABG/project_images/Random.jpg" alt="" /> --> The Jardin Botanico Las Orquideas is a restored forest located in 6 ha of rainforest pasture. This area of the Amazon is particularly poor in soil fertility, and natural re-vegetation is often slow and dominated by few pioneer species. Traditional indigenous cultures used a shifting cultivation method involving clearing of 1-3 ha patches followed by 2-5 years of cultivation and then allowing natural re-vegetation. However, the last 50 years of development in the region is dominated by clearing, a few years of cultivation, followed by cattle grazing.&nbsp
