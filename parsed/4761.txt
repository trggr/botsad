Making South African Plants widely available has been our mission since New Plant nursery was founded more than ten years ago by Mandy and Paul Fick. ;  ;  Retailers and landscapers will know that the demand for indigenous planting and gardening is growing all the time, especially since we wish to safeguard our biodiversity in the face of rapid development. ;  ;  South African plants include such diversity that there will always be something 'New' available. Landscape rehabilitation is becoming more and more important, but the plant material, especially area-specific genotypes and endemics, are not always available. We hope to bridge that gap with our consulting and growing services. ;  ;  The Team: ;  ;  Our enthusiastic workforce is devoted to their work, and New Plant Nursery in turn, invests in the personal development, growth and training of employees. We foster a culture of mutual respect, recognition of personal performance, achievement and leadership development. Our employees are empowered in the decision-making process of the nursery and share in profits as if they were already shareholders. ;  ;  The final formalisation of our aimed 51% Black Empowerment share is underway. We believe in investing in our people and their future success through skills transfer and economic empowerment. We are comitted to actively promoting community involvement and skills transfer through our training and community greening programmes.;                        Main Address:;         New Plant Nursery;         Victoria Bay Rd;        George East;        George;        Western Cape 6539 South Africa;        ;                 Telephone: +27-44-8890055;         Fax: +27-44-8890101;         URL: http://www.newplant.co.za;         Primary Email: info@newplant.co.za       ;
