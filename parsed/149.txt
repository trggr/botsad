It is located in Belém, the noblest and most monumental part of the city of Lisbon. Created in 1906 under the name of The Colonial Garden, it was conceived as a centre of experimentation of cultures and as a space to collect information regarding tropical agriculture; it was considered an “indispensable support to the teaching activity”.;  The plant collection in the garden consists of species mainly from tropical and subtropical regions, with economic and botanic interest like spices, fruit, medicinal, stimulants, and fibers among others, many of which have a particular historical connection to the age of discoveries of the Portuguese explorers. Also, we find there some species threatened in their natural habitats, like cycads, and some rare species of palms. ;  Linked to this remarkable natural heritage we have historical buildings such as a Palace (Palácio dos Condes da Calheta), tile panels, and marble sculptures that include different aesthetics concepts which span several historical periods, from the XVII century to the XX century. ;  Scientific research activities in tropical themes, namely in biodiversity and tropical ecosystems, are carried out there. Being a space open to the public, JBT should also be understood as a privileged place for the promotion of interdisciplinary research activity developed at the IICT, which encompasses themes both from Natural and Human Sciences. The garden holds an important role in allowing the public to make acquaintance with the tropical sciences, contributing to the promotion of scientific culture in the Portuguese society and in the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries.;                        Main Address:;         Jardim Botânico Tropical;         Largo de Belém;                Lisbon;        1400-209 Portugal;        ;                 Telephone: (351) 213 921 808;         Fax: ;         URL: https://www.museus.ulisboa.pt/pt-pt/jardim-botanico-tropical;         Primary Email: geral@museus.ulisboa.pt       ;
