It was developed by Shelby White, trustee of the Foundation, in honour of her late husband, Leon Levy. The Preserve is a living part of Bahamian history. It is the first national park on the island of Eleuthera. It is an environmental educational centre as well as a facility for the conservation of native plants and trees. ;  ;  The Leon Levy Native Plant Preserve is the fulfillment of the vision of longtime residents Leon Levy and Shelby White, who loved the natural environment and way of life on Eleuthera. After Leon Levy’s death in 2003, Shelby White wanted to celebrate her husband’s devotion to the island while contributing to a better future for all Eleutherans.;                        Main Address:;         Leon Levy Native Plant Preserve;         PO Box EL-25151;                Governors Harbour;        Eleuthera 00000 Bahamas;        ;                 Telephone: 242-332-3831;         Fax: ;         URL: www.levypreserve.org;         Primary Email: efreid@bnt.bs       ;

8-">The Bahamas is a low-lying archipelago that while made up of many islands, across a large distance, most are small in size. The largest islands in the archipelago are dominated by Pine Woodlands with little available habitat for Caribbean Dry Forest. The majority of the islands with Caribbean Dry Forest are small and/or very narrow. Caribbean Dry Forest is an ecosystem under extreme threat due to its relatively small habitat area and a long history of human alteration for farming and resource extraction. While the Caribbean region is considered a biodiversity hotspot, natural areas continue to be degraded with a concurrent loss in biodiversity. As an ecosystem, it is considered to be globally rare and endangered. In The Bahamas, throughout most of its range, the disturbed habitat has also been invaded by non-native invasive species such as <em>Casuarina equisetifolia</em>, <em>Schinus terebinthifolius</em>, and <em>Leuceana leucocephala</em>. The LLNPP has undertaken as part of its mission the creation of a native plant nursery producing a large range of tree species. On the Preserve the goal has been to return degraded areas to natural conditions and use them as a showcase for how restoration in the Bahamas can be done. <p style="text-align: left

8-school program was established. The LLNPP works with schools to identify areas that natives can be planted and then provides trees for the students to plant. The first set of trees was planted in summer 2019 at a local middle school on Eleuthera. <p style="text-align: left
