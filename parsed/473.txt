Garden flowerbeds cover 4500 square meters and host about 700 species divided into four thematic sections: Systematics, Theme gardens, Useful plants, Protected flora. The greenhouses, located on the eastern edge of the Botanical Garden, are divided into three areas: Cold House, Temperate House and Hothouse. Greenhouse plants are about 1300 species coming from equatorial, tropical and subtropical regions and making very interesting collections. In spring and summer many greenhouse plants are carried outdoor on special structures so as to constitute a fifth section: Exotic plants.;                        Main Address:;         Orto Botanico dell`Universita di Ferrara;         Universita degli Studi di Ferrara;        Dipartimento di Biologia ed Evoluzione - Orto Botanico;        Ferrara;        Emilia Romagna 44121 Italy;        ;                 Telephone: +39 0532 293782;         Fax: +39 0532 208561;         URL: http://www.unife.it/dipartimento/biologia-evoluzione/strutture/orto-botanico;         Primary Email: ortobotanico@unife.it       ;
