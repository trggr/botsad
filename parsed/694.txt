As the botanical collection was planted fifty years before the animals were introduced, the exhibits carefully maximize the space around decades old trees. Because of this special need to conserve space, you will be very close to the animals -- often just three or four steps away!;                        Main Address:;         Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens;         1590 Goodlette-Frank Road;                Naples;        Florida 34102 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (239) 262-5409 ext. 124;         Fax: ;         URL: www.napleszoo.com;         Primary Email: info@napleszoo.org       ;
