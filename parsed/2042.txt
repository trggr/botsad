It serves multiple functions, including botanical research, scientific education, ex situ conservation, exhibition, and tourism. It is also the only integrated organization for botanical research, conservation and utilization in Shenzhen.;  The missions of SZBG are to preserve tropical and subtropical plants ex situ, to carry out both basic and applied research, to provide insights about urban greening and landscape, and to supply innovative environmental education. We strive to satisfy visitors to the Garden by providing both a picturesque landscape and exceptional service. We have archieved a series of academic accomplishments in basic research, with special reference to certain groups such as cycads, magnolias, bryophytes, ferns, African violet family (Gesneriaceae), and the study of plant genomes. To serve the rapidly growing city of Shenzhen, we have developed core technologies and products in applied research on urban gardening and landscapes, vertical greening, and the utilization of medicinal and ornamental plants. We supply exhibitions and courses in novel ways for the general public, with a special focus on children and teenagers.;                        Main Address:;         Fairy Lake Botanical Garden, Shenzhen & Chinese Academy of Sciences;         160 Xianhu Road;        Liantang, Luohu District;        Shenzhen;        Guangdong 518004 China;        ;                 Telephone: 86 (0)755 2570 4480;         Fax: 86 (0)755 2570 4480;         URL: www.szbg.ac.cn;         Primary Email: donghui@szbg.ac.cn       ;
