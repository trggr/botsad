The Arboretum is an ideal place to observe the rhythm of the seasons, each bringing their own lighting according to natureâ€™s cycle:	the blooming of magnolias and Japanese cherry trees in the spring, the shimmering coloration of the maple foliage in autumn and even the silhouettes of trees in winter. Do not hesitate to come back often !
