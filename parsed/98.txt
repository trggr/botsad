Special Collections:	The focus of the living collections is based upon ornamental cultivated plants with a small subset of plants being of wild origin and having ex-situ conservation value. As a result, the horticultural work taking place within the living collections is centered upon horticultural research and science, trials and evaluation, education and horticultural display. For a plant to be accessioned within a collection it must have taxonomic, geographic, horticultural, morphological, display, economic, thematic or conservation significance.
Â·Veggie Village:	100 Mile Produce Gardens encourages visitors to eat vegetables produced locally in keeping with the one hundred mile diet and promotes ideas on food security, plant biodiversity while empowering visitors to engage with ways of reducing their carbon footprint.
