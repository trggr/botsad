Name:	Die GÃ¤rten von Schloss Trauttmansdorff / I Giardini di Castel Trauttmansdorff / The Gardens of Traut 
A third project is devoted to the ex-situ conservation of a carnivorous aquatic plant, which is rarely found locally:	the Utricularia stygia. Trauttmansdorff cultivates the plants from a population that existed in Lake Caldaro up until 2010, with the aim of reintroducing them into their native waters.

Trauttmansdorff is divided into four garden worlds:	Forests of the world, the Sun Gardens, the Landscapes of South Tyrol (Northern Italy) and the Water and Terraced Gardens. While the latter features historical European garden architecture, the central theme for the three other garden worlds is a comparison of natural and cultural landscapes. The plants in this garden landscapes are grouped by their geographic origin and form a multitude of vegetation and landscape typologies.
