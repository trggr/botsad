The woodland contains black walnuts, swamp cypress, cedars, limes and a very fine Caucasian wing nut (Pterocarya fraxinifolia). The pioneer of photography, William Henry Fox Talbot, lived here during the 19th century and the woodland garden is the result of his botanical interests. So too is the Botanic Garden, which contains collections of plants known to have interested him, including geraniums,  digitalis, eryngiums, euphorbias, and some tender Mediterranean plants. The lean-to greenhouses in the botanic garden contain grapevines, a display house with plants of seasonal interest, and a section of almost hardy South African and other exotics species. A clearing in the woodland contains a rose garden dedicated to Fox Talbot's mother, Lady Elisabeth. Other features include an orchard, medieval stewpond with carp and 18th-century summer-house. Impressive display of spring flowers including aconites, snakeshead fritillaries, anemones and crocus vernus.;                        Main Address:;         Lacock Abbey;                         Chippenham;        Wiltshire SN15 2LG United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lacock/;         Primary Email:        ;
