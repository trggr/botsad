In late 2003 it was transferred to the Tatton Garden Society who now own the Arboretum.  The Arboretum is home to a colourful range of plants including snowdrops, crocus and daffodils in the Spring. Trees and shrubs add their seasonal attractions from early flowers to berries and autumn colour. To help visitors most of the plants labelled. The Arboretum is maintained to encourage wildlife and increase biodiversity. ;  Currently we have around 2,500 trees and shrubs, including National Collections of Pine (Pinus) and Ash (Fraxinus) There is also a large collection of Hebe in trial beds planted by the Hebe Society.;                        Main Address:;         Tatton Garden Society/The Lovell Quinta Arboretum;         The Old Hay Barn,Mere Estate;        Warrington Road;        Knutsford;        Cheshire WA16 0PY United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 01565 831981;         Fax: ;         URL: www.tattongardensociety.co.uk;         Primary Email: tattongardensociety@hotmail.com       ;
