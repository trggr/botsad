Special Collections:	The seed of this project was planted over three decades ago when Merwin purchased a plot of land in Peahi Valley on the north shore of Maui, Hawaii. Over the span of nearly thirty-five years, Merwin built an ecologically conscious home for himself and his wife Paula as well as planted more than 4,000 trees representing nearly 850 species of endemic, indigenous and endangered palms. He has transforming a place that was once considered “wasteland” into a lush and rare 19-acre tropical forest.
