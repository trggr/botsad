The plant collections are a unique blend of gardens and exhibits that demonstrate the diversity of plants and their relationship to humans and animals. Over 3,000 kinds of plants provide informative and educational resources for all plant enthusiasts. Exploring the Garden each season provides a new and changing look in the landscape. Bright vivid spring flowers, including 80,000 tulips and thousands of flowering trees and shrubs transition to a lush and vibrant summer landscape. Autumn is adorned with brilliant colors giving way to winter's brightly colored fruits and berries and a clear view of the impressive architecture of regal trees throughout the Garden. A visit to the Zoo is a global adventure where exhibits simulate natural habitats for animals and plants. Exploring the Garden is a walk through tropical rainforests, an African savanna, Florida swamps, the Arctic tundra and the native eastern American woodlands to name a few.
