Today the beautiful and peaceful garden has been restored in the early 19th century Picturesque style. Pass through the imposing Golden Gates, down the driveway lined with Norway maple, along serpentine pathways created by island beds into the Wide Glade. Grass terraces running parallel to the south front of the house date back to the early 18th century from where there are superb views over the former deer park and out to the Solent. The old 'wash garden' is now a scented and tranquil corner.;                        Main Address:;         Uppark House and Garden;         South Harting;                Petersfield;        West Sussex GU31 5QR United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/uppark/;         Primary Email:        ;
