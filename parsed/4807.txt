Surrounding the house are a series of formal gardens, terraces, yew hedges, an orchard and a daffodil meadow. Below, the sheltered valley garden, containing exotic and tender plants, drops steeply towards the Tamar. Fragments of Cotehele's long history are to be found everywhere, including a medieval stew pond and domed dovecote in the valley, and the 18th-century Prospect Tower on the hill above.;  Main Address:; Cotehele; St Dominick; Redruth; Cornwall PL12 6TA United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cotehele/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cotehele/; Primary Email: ;
