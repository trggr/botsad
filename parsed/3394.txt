Their home, Maymont, was bequeathed to the City of Richmond in 1925. Today the estate is appreciated as an unusually complete example of an American country place of the Gilded Age in which magnificent landscaping was an essential part.;                        Main Address:;         Maymont Foundation;         1700 Hampton Street;                Richmond;        Virginia 23220 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (804) 358-7166;         Fax: (804) 358-9994;         URL: www.maymont.org;         Primary Email: info@maymont.org       ;
