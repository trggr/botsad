The identity of the Garden goes hand in hand with the relaunch of its mission and its cultural role, precisely because (as written in 1980 by the authors Poldini, Gioitti, Martini and Budin in the book “Introduzione alla flora e alla vegetazione del Carso” ("An introduction to the flora and vegetation of the Karst”), “Carsiana is an environmental education tool that, by influencing the conscience of the population, can contribute to a correct use of the local environment and its resources”. With this direction indicated by the founders, a logo was therefore sought to identify the most threatened and precious element of the Karst today:	the landa carsica. These dry grasslands have always been perceived as not very productive and therefore of little value, but in reality they constitute an enormous patrimony of biodiversity, protected by Regional, national and European Union legislation and of which the whole community should feel themselves the guardians.
The words of the writer Scipio Slataper:	“My Karst is hard and good. Each of its blades of grass has split the rock to sprout, each of its flowers has drunk of the heat to unfold.” echoed in the minds of the Working Group. Thus a flower was sought that represented the perseverance and tenacity of life that emerges from the rock and after careful consideration, the choice thus fell on Rock Knapweed (Centaurea rupestris), a humble and inconspicuous flower, disheveled by the Bora wind and yellow like the summer sun.

In the field layer we find Asarabacca (Asarum europaeum). Thus these two species together provide the name of the sinkholes’ particular plant association:	the Asaro-Carpinetum betuli. On the woodland floor there is also Dog's-tooth Violet (Erythronium dens-canis), Spring Pea (Lathyrus vernus), Wood Anemone (Anemonoides nemorosa), False Rue-anemone (Isopyrum thalictroides) and Alpine Squill (Scilla bifolia).
