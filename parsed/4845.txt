Classical temples, including the Pantheon and Temple of Apollo, are set around the central lake at the end of a series of vistas, which change as the visitor moves around the paths and through the magnificent mature woodland with its extensive collection of exotic trees. Built in the 1720s the mansion was home to the Hoare family. King Alfreds Tower, an intriguing red-brick folly built in 1772 by Henry Flitcroft, is almost 50m high and gives breathtaking views over the estate. Much of the estate woodland and downland is managed for nature conservation and there are two interesting Iron Age hill-forts, Whitesheet Hill and Park Hill Camp.;  Main Address:; Stourhead; Stourhead Estate Office; Stourton; Warminster; Wiltshire BA12 6QD United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stourhead/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stourhead/; Primary Email: ;
