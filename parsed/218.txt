Extending over 15 hectares it is part of Riga’s green landscape, containing 5,400 different plants.  When Latvia was part of the Soviet Union (1940-1991), the work of all botanic gardens was coordinated by the USSR Council of Botanical Garden.  The Council established a common scientific theme ‘Introduction and Acclimatisation of Plants’, resulting in the University of Latvia botanic garden carrying out the introduction, selection and biological study of economically valuable plants.  As well as agricultural plants, these were mostly fruit and decorative plants.  Notable achievements were made in the selection of peaches and apricots suitable for Latvia’s agro-climatic conditions and the introduction, selection and physiological study of rhododendrons.;                        Main Address:;         Botanical Garden of the University of Latvia, The;         2 Kandavas Street;                Riga;        LV-1083 Latvia;        ;                 Telephone: +371 67450852;         Fax: +371 67450852;         URL: www.botanika.lv;         Primary Email: botdarzs@lanet.lv       ;
