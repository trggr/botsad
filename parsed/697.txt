9-Best management practices are being demonstrated through conservation agriculture, showing our visitors that working landscapes can serve the dual purpose of habitat creation and farm production. Prairie buffer plantings surround a central farm field to provide enhanced pollination potential, while adding interest and beauty. <img style="display: block
