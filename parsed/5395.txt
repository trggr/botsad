Today, the Collection is botanical garden and is open to students and public. It is actively involved in the activities of the Working group for the gene pools, which secures conservation of the critically endangered domestic flora in ex situ collections of the botanical gardens. The exposition of our botanical garden includes more than 700 species of aquatic and wetland plants. The majority come from Central Europe. Our collection contains common plants of our streams, rivers and ponds, and also rare species of plants, including the ones that have become extinct from our nature.;                        Main Address:;         Hortus Botanicus Třeboň;         Department of Experimental Garden and Collection of Aquatic and Wetland Plants, Institute of Botany of Czech Academy of Sciences;        Dukelská 135;        Třeboň;        CZ 37901 Czech Republic;        ;                 Telephone: +420384721156;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.butbn.cas.cz/sbirkavk/?lang=en;         Primary Email: Jana.Navratilova@ibot.cas.cz       ;
