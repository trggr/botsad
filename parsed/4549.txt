It comprises two very large bush gardens which allow for many different microclimates. The garden is situated at approximately 1100 m above sea level and is built on a ridge of floating basalt. The climate here is cool temperate with winter minimums reaching -15C and summer maximums rarely exceeding 35C. The garden hosts the National living Correa collection. The owner and collector, Maria Hitchcock was Leader of the ANPSA Correa Study Group for 16 years and developed the collection during that time. She is author of 'Correas - Australian Plants for Waterwise Gardens (Rosenberg 2010). Maria is currently Leader of the ANPSA Waratah and Flannel Flower Study Group and is establishing a collection of hybrid Waratahs in the garden. The area experienced a major drought in 2013-14 which has has continued into 2019 making it the worst drought on record. The gardens are watered sparingly from a reliable bore and the water quality is favourable for garden conditions.;                        Main Address:;         Fangorn, private garden;         16 Hitchcock Lane;                Armidale;        New South Wales 2350 Australia;        ;                 Telephone: 02 67 751139;         Fax: ;         URL: correacollection.weebly.com;         Primary Email: maria.hitchcock@gmail.com       ;
