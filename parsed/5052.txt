Known as the master of the naturalistic approach to landscaping, Jensen's design style combines woodlands, meadows and wetlands in such a natural way that guests are usually not conscious of any man-made design. Jensen was known for his use of native plants, the sense of vast open space, the play of light and shadow and the element of time and season's change.; ; His approach to landscape architecture sought to engage all five human senses- the sight of many colors and shapes, the sound of water running, the smell of flowers in bloom, the taste of berries, and the feeling of being surrounded by nature.;  Main Address:; Edsel and Eleanor Ford House; 1100 Lake Shore Road; Grosse Pointe Shores; Michigan MI 48236, United States of America; ;  Telephone: (313) 884-4222; Fax: (313) 884-5977; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fordhouse.org/">http://www.fordhouse.org/; Primary Email: ;
