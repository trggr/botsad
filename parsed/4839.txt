Info:	  United Kingdom - North Yorkshire - Helmsley  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Rievaulx Terrace & Temples A landscape terrace garden, laid out in 1749 by Thomas Duncombe II, set high on a hill, overlooking the upper Rye Valley. The serpentine grass terrace is framed by a backdrop of woodland and flowering shrub fringe, with temples - one Ionic, the other Tuscan - situated at either end. Thirteen vistas cut through the steep wooded bank offer glimpses of the magnificent ruins of Rievaulx Abbey and surrounding village. This bank, designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is managed for its wildlife and plant communities, notably deadwood invertebrates (no public access). The adjoining grassy bank is noted for its wild flowers, of particular interest in May and June with large numbers of cowslips and early purple orchids. The backdrop woodland is currently undergoing renovation, with new tree planting and restoration of the shrub fringe, recapturing the original 18th-century style.;  Main Address:; Rievaulx Terrace & Temples; Rievaulx; Helmsley; North Yorkshire YO62 5LJ United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rievaulx-terrace/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rievaulx-terrace/; Primary Email: ;
