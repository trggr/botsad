Key collections include therefore plants originating from the Mediterranean basin such as Quercus ilex, Myrtus communis, Arbutus unedo, Cupressus sempervirens, Nerium oleander, Spartium junceum, Pinus maritima, P. halepensis, P. pinea and from SE Asia such as Citruses, Cinnamomum camphora, Trachycarpus fortunei and various spcies of bamboos. Another special interest are American conifers such as Sequoia sempervirens, Chamaecyparis lawsonoiana and Cupressus lusitanica.
