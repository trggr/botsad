The garden has special emphasis on medicinal plants that are very essential to the welfare of poor communities in terms of known medicinal values. In 2005, NPBG was registered as a participant in the world-wide implementation of the International Agenda in support of Plant Conservation, Environmental Awareness and Sustainable Development.  ;  ;  In 2005, NPBG won an a grant from HSBC Bank Plc to implement the 'Poverty Alleviation and Health care Promotion through Conservation'(PHP-C) project.  Under this project NPBG is strengthening community collaboration in conservation and  developing a preliminary national list of threatened plants while documenting Indigenous Knowledge on Medicinal Plants.  As a result of this project, there is more and closer collaboration between the Botanic Garden and the neighboring communities.  A strong Community Conservation and Development group emerged and they are involved in the cultivation as well as promoting conservation of indigenous medicinal plants.  The group is also involved in processing herbal formula for sale to other people in the community and beyond thereby improving on their income and livelihoods.;  ;  For more information about the PHP-C project please contact David at: naturepaldn@gmail.com;  ;  Traditional Medicine Day, 31st August;  ;  Uganda joins other African countries to mark the African Traditional Medicine Day on every 31st of August. ;  ;  This day is very important for African countries since close to 80% of the population in Africa continue to rely on traditional medicine for healthy delivery.  The day also underscores the need for conservation of Medicinal plants. ;  ;  Nature Palace Foundation is involved in Conservation of Ugandaâ€™s biodiversity with special interest in Plants with Medicinal properties (which of course most have).  We are happy to see the increasing appreciation of the contribution of Medicinal plants to the well-being of the population, especially the poorer, and unfortunately, broader layer of the population.;                        Main Address:;         Nature Palace Botanical Gardens;         Jandira/Luwule;        PO Box 29455;        Kampala;        256414 Uganda;        ;                 Telephone: +256-772-625963;         Fax: ;         URL: http://botanic.naturepalace.net/;         Primary Email: naturepaldn@gmail.com       ;
