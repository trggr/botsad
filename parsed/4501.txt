It was first referred to as an "arboretum" in May 1879, only six years after the university was founded. The arboretum seeks to represent the variety of trees native to Tennessee as well as to illustrate various ornamental species. The collection contains approximately 5625 identified and geolocated trees representing about 170 species of trees and shrubs.  It contains one national champion tree (September elm), and four Tennessee state champion trees (September elm, Japanese zelkova, green hawthorn, and hedge maple).;                        Main Address:;         Vanderbilt University Arboretum;         Campus Planning & Construction;        122 Bryan Building;        Nashville;        Tennessee 37240 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (615) 322-2715;         Fax: (615) 343-4830;         URL: http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/arboretum;         Primary Email: steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu       ;
