A wooded valley with open areas in which many half-hardy trees and shrubs thrive. Managed in as natural a state as possible, Greenway boasts a superb plant collection with great rarities from all over the world, but mainly from the southern hemisphere. The garden has a mysterious, wild character with stunning native flora.;                        Main Address:;         Greenway;         Greenway Road;        Galmpton;        Brixhan;        Devon TQ5 0ES United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/greenway/;         Primary Email:        ;
