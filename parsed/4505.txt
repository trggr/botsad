With hundreds of perennials, annuals, and trees it provides an ideal setting for a leisurely walk, lunch, family gathering, wedding or reception, company picnic, photography session, or just a serene place for contemplation. ;  ;  Visitors can find answers and glean ideas to inspire and enhance their own quality of life through improved plant selection, cultural practices, and environmentally sound methods.  Classes and events through the year offer opportunities to connect with other gardeners (whether novices or those with hard-earned green thumbs) to learn and share ideas.;                        Main Address:;         Ogden Botanical Gardens;         1750 Monroe Boulevard;                Ogden;        Utah 84401 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (801) 399-8080;         Fax: ;         URL: http://extension.usu.edu/weber/htm/horticulture;         Primary Email:        ;
