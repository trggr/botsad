On 11 hectares, the field collections, collections in greenhouses and secondary forests host over 3,000 species of plants.;  ;  The origin of Lankester Botanical Garden goes back to the 1910's when the British naturalist Charles H. Lankester (1879-1969) became interested in the study and cultivation of Costa Rica's epiphytic plants. As an amateur botanist, he collaborated with the most prominent orchidologists of his time and dedicated his life to the creation of a private garden in his farm. After his death, the importance of preserving his garden became evident. Through the joint efforts of the American Orchid Society and the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the garden of “don Carlos” was donated to the University of Costa Rica on March 2nd, 1973, with the promise to transform it into a botanical garden. With dedication and much effort, the Lankester Botanical Garden has become one of the most active and important botanical institutions of the Neotropics.;                        Main Address:;         Jardín Botánico Lankester;         Universidad de Costa Rica;                Cartago;        Cartago 302-7050 Costa Rica;        ;                 Telephone: (506) 2511-7931;         Fax: (506) 2511-7937;         URL: www.jbl.ucr.ac.cr;         Primary Email: jardinbotanico.lankester@ucr.ac.cr       ;
