E. Forbes, who used basket-weave brick paths and fine masonry in walls and outhouses to give the garden structure. Gertrude Jekyll advised on the planting of this varied and enchanting garden laid out in a series of contrasting "rooms". A lovely white garden has been added by the present head gardener, Christine Brain. Seasonal fruit and vegetables are tended in the walled kitchen garden and used in the restaurant.;                        Main Address:;         Barrington Court;         Barrington;                Ilminster;        Somerset TA19 0NQ United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/barrington-court/;         Primary Email:        ;
