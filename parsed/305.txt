His nursery developed to a major tree-garden thanks to Van Geerts successors: Antoine Kort and Robert & Jelena de Belder.; ; Throughout the whole year, Arboretum Kalmthout is worth a visit.; ; Spring; Carpets of flowering groundcovers freshly sprouting Japanese maples and the delicate blossoms of cherry and apple trees herald the arrival of spring. Whilst hundreds of Rhododendrons turn the garden into a festival of colour.; ; Summer; A summer palette of Hydrangea’s, roses, Agapanthus and dahlia’s may be enjoyed during a gentle stroll through the garden or while relaxing on bench in the shade. The butterfly garden reaches its peak: exploding with colour, teaming with butterflies and other insects. During the summer there are several evening walks and concerts in the garden theatre.; ; Autumn; Autumn is marked by a plethora of fruit in all shapes and colours, a veritable banquet for birds, squirrels and other animals. Many trees have also been planted for their striking autumnal foliage. The arboretum is the prefect place to celebrate an ‘Indian Summer’.; ; Winter; Contrary to what most people think, the winter garden is filled with flowers! The arboretum boasts a world renowned collections of witchhazels (<i>Hamamelis</i>), but there are hundreds of other winterflowering shrubs and plants that will delight you.
