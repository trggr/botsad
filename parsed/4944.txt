Still remaining as a scientific and teaching garden the 1.5 acre site is now a secure public garden to be enjoyed by all. The System Garden contains cultivated garden beds that represent the evolution of plants from the non flowering Gymnosperms, mosses, cycads and conifers through to the vast flowering Angiosperms. Centrally located is the original and unique potting shed tower from when the garden was established.;                        Main Address:;         University of Melbourne Grounds and Gardens;         625-631 Swanston Street, Carlton;                Melbourne;        Victoria 3053 Australia;        ;                 Telephone: 0425832554;         Fax: ;         URL: http://maps.unimelb.edu.au/parkville/poi/system_garden;         Primary Email: tu@unimelb.edu.au       ;
