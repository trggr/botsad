It was opened in 1982 and now has over 10,000 plants from all over the world. ;  ;  Our vision:;  ;      * Through provision of a spectacular South Pacific Garden we aspire to contribute to our communityâ€™s wellbeing and appreciation of plants.;  ;      * The vast range of plants on display reflects the regions benevolent climate, and parallels our diverse landscape and ethnic mix.;  ;      * Most importantly the gardens should meet the needs and interests of our community, and they should inspire and inform people about the importance of plants in their lives and to the environment.;  ;  A key objective in the development of the Botanic Gardens has been to identify those plants best suited to growing in Auckland conditions. A trial programme was established to enable assessment of ornamental plants and to publish Advisory Leaflets recommending reliable subjects for home gardens.;                        Main Address:;         Auckland Botanic Gardens;         102 Hill Road;        Manurewa;        Auckland;        2105 New Zealand;        ;                 Telephone: 64 (09) 267-1457;         Fax: 64 (09) 266-3698;         URL: www.aucklandbotanicgardens.co.nz;         Primary Email: botanic.gardens@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz       ;
