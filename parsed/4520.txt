It is a leading research institution in the field of introduction and acclimatisation, physiology, selection and genetics of plants. The botanical garden has a unique collection which numbers nearly 5000 taxa of higher vascular plants. The Botanical Garden is located in Bishkek, in the foothills area of the Chui Valley at about 900 meters altitude. The total area is 150 hectares. ;  ;  From 2009 as part of a Darwin Initiative-funded project (2009 – 2012) on participative forest management in the Tian-Shan region of Kyrgyzstan, Gareev Botanical Garden has been working with Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) to create a panel exhibition containing information on key species of Kyrgyzstan’s fruit and nut forests. The botanic garden provides an ideal vehicle to publicise the conservation work of the project and reach out to a large public regarding the importance of the wild fruit and nut forests of Kyrgyzstan. Many of the species that have been researched under this Darwin Initiative, grow in the garden’s living collections offering thereby an excellent opportunity to visualise these species live supported by special displays and plant labels.;                        Main Address:;         Gareev Botanical Garden of the National Academy of Sciences, Kyrgyzstan;         1-a  Akhunbaeva str.;                Bishkek;        720064 Kyrgyzstan;        ;                 Telephone: +996(312)517355, 517932;         Fax: +996(312)517355;         URL: www.botanica.kg;         Primary Email: gareev100@mail.ru       ;
