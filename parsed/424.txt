It was founded by Franz Späth in 1879 and landscaped in the English style by Berlin's Garden director Gustav Meyer. Since 1961 the Späth-Arboretum is part of Berlin's Humboldt-University and provides plant material for research, academic teaching and public environmental education. Its roughly 4000 plant accessions include 1200 woody plants, among which there are many rare cultivars and hybrids. Reflecting its initial function as a presentation garden of Späth's tree nursery, the trees an shrubs are not arranged according to systematic or geographical relationship, but rather according to aesthetic principles. Both, its collection of woody plants and its landscaping earned the Späth-Arboretum in 1998 the International Dendrology Society's "Distinction for Merit".;                        Main Address:;         Späth-Arboretum der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin;         Institut für Biologie, AG Botanik & Arboretum;        Späthstr. 80 / 81;        Berlin;        12437 Germany - Deutschland;        ;                 Telephone: +49 (0)30 6366941;         Fax: +49 (0)30 6369446;         URL: ;         Primary Email: arboretum@hu-berlin.de       ;
