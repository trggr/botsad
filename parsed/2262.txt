Montgomery germinates these seeds in its nursery and grows the resulting plants in population-based, documented, scientific collections. Montgomery fosters, and participates in, scientific research by collecting and maintaining scientific data on its collections, by making its collections and scientific data available to scientists for research purposes, and by disseminating this research and data through scientific publications. Montgomery cooperates with many botanical institutions and countries around the world by making its plant collections, knowledge and expertise available to their scientists, educators, and students.  Montgomery explains its mission and operations to the general public through workshops, lectures, publications and tours of the plant collections in its garden.;  ;  Montgomery hosts Nationally Accredited Palm, Cycad, and Tropical Conifer Collections certified by the Plant Collections Network (PCN) of the American Public Gardens Association (APGA):;  ;  http://www.publicgardens.org/web/2008/02/montgomery_botanical_center.aspx;  ;  http://www.publicgardens.org/web/2008/02/montgomery_botanical_center__cy.aspx;                        Main Address:;         Montgomery Botanical Center;         11901 Old Cutler Road;                Coral Gables;        Florida 33156 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (305) 667-3800;         Fax: (305) 661-5984;         URL: www.montgomerybotanical.org;         Primary Email: patrick@montgomerybotanical.org       ;
