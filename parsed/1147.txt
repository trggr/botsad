Because of its proximity to downtown, the Garden is well situated and hosts a wide variety of public and private events and exhibitions. It occupies 30-acres adjacent to Piedmont Park, the most heavily-used public park in the city.  The Garden encompasses 13 acres of woodland and 15 acres of cultivated gardens.  Included among these gardens are two acres for the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Children’s Garden (1999), along with the Dorothy Chapman Fuqua Conservatory (1989), the Fuqua Orchid Center and Center for Education and Conservation(2002), Gardenhouse, the administrative center (1985), and Mershon Hall for youth education and meeting room(2003).  The Garden was organized by a grassroots group of citizens in the mid-1970s without benefit of financial bequest nor estate grounds, and is privately funded under the leadership of the Board of Trustees and the Executive Director, Mary Pat Matheson. Responsiveness to the surrounding community has always been its touchstone. In Nov, 2007 the Green Expansion Plan broke ground, to build a LEED-certified Visitor Center with green roof, a green parking facility tucked into a steep hillside, a Canopy Walk soaring 40 feet into the tree canopy, a 95,000 gallon cistern to harvest stormwater runoff including a cascade and edible plant gardens.   ;  Smithgall Woodland Garden is a 185-acre satellite garden 60 miles northeast in Gainesville, Georgia, which opened to the public in 2014.;                        Main Address:;         Atlanta Botanical Garden;         1345 Piedmont Avenue NE;                Atlanta;        Georgia 30309-3366 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (404) 876-5859;         Fax: (404) 876-7472;         URL: www.atlantabg.org;         Primary Email: ecoffey@atlantabg.org       ;

8-In 1990, Atlanta Botanical Garden received 155 clones of <em>T. taxifolia</em> propagated from the remaining natural population by Arnold Arboretum and the Center for Plant Conservation. This material has been safeguarded at the Atlanta Botanical Garden since that time, and propagation efforts have increased the collection to include almost 1,000 plants, including nearly 500 distinct vegetative clones from the wild. One of the limiting factors to <em>ex situ</em> conservation of this species is the inability to use conventional seed storage techniques for preserving germplasm. <em>Torreya taxifolia</em> produces recalcitrant wet seeds that cannot be dried for storage in freezers. Therefore, until recently the only way to maintain <em>ex situ</em> germplasm was through living collections. In collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology, a somatic embryogenesis tissue culture system was developed to initiate cultures, produce somatic seedlings and cryogenically store cultures of <em>T. taxifolia.</em> <h6 style="text-align: center
