These materials will bring together both new and old information in a manner that will clarify basic principles and place them in one central location.;  The final part  of our mission is related to the conservation of these species. This involves the establishment of a protected area or garden and seed bank which are strictly dedicated to the protection of these species. Equally important is the development of a plan whereby species which are mass produced can be re-introduced into their native habitat through the utilization of university students in those regions. Also part of the final phase   is the educating the general public with regard to which of these species are endangered, why it is important to conserve them, and what they can do to ensure their existence. Our collection currently has 951 species, varieties, or cultivars within this one family.;                        Main Address:;         Botresearch USA Seed Bank and Research Collection;         23410 Harpergate Drive;                Spring;        Texas 77373 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (281) 350-1707;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.botresearch.com;         Primary Email:        ;
