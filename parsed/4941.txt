Created in 1938 by landscape architect Louis Perron, this garden combines French classic style with English-style mixed borders. More than 150 species can be admired: annual flowers and bulbous plants but most of all, perennials. Under the charm of Quebec City, a couple of Americans, including the sculptress herself Anna Hyatt Huntington, donated the Joan of Arc statue “A tribute to the patriotism and courage of the heroes of 1759-1760”, according to the inscription on the monument.;  Main Address:; Joan of Arc Garden; 380 Avenue de Bernières; Quebec; Quebec G1R 2L7 Canada; ;  Telephone: (418) 649-6157; Fax: (418) 648-3809; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lesplainesdabraham.ca/index.html">http://www.lesplainesdabraham.ca/index.html; Primary Email: information@ccbn-nbc.gc.ca ;
