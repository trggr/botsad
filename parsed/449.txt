The park has been enlarged three times since 1912 and is now about 3.6 ha and lies at 40-50 m altitude at Eyrarlandsvegur road near midtown. ;  ;  The aims of the activity in the Botanic Garden are several. The most important task is to provide northern Iceland in general with trees, shrubs and perennials that fulfil demands upon beauty and hardiness. The garden is also meant to function as genebank for hardy plants suitable to the weather conditions in Iceland. Apart from that the general idea is multiple use, such as seed-exchange, public information, education and recreation. ;  ;  There are about 6600 alien taxa growing in the garden now in beds and nursery and around 430 species of the native taxa.;                        Main Address:;         Lystigardur Akureyrar;         Public Park and Botanic Garden, P.O.
