Their true roots are in the geology and natural and human history of their sites, topography, and geographical location. Their past, present, and future are the work of highly committed individuals. ;  ;  On Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens’ 248 acres, the natural elements are more evident than in smaller, more-manicured properties or urban settings. Our size enables our designers, including acclaimed landscape architects Herb Schaal, FASLA, principal of EDAW in Colorado, and Bruce John Riddell, ASLA, of Bar Harbor and Boothbay, Maine, to create gardens and landscapes on a scale seldom found in botanical gardens. ;  ;  You’ll see glorious formal gardens here, and an overall design that’s both appealing and impressive; but you’ll also find antique stone walls; nearly a mile of sparkling waterfront; massive ledges covered in mosses, lichens, and ferns; and native forest – in fact, the essence of Maine. ;  ;  The combination is unbeatable, as we’ve heard over and over again from our visitors. Their enthusiasm will become yours as you discover the Gardens for yourself. You can see the highlights in a few hours; or you can explore forever, experiencing the grounds in different seasons and varying weather conditions. And, of course, you can watch our gardens grow and bloom and transform themselves into something altogether different within a familiar framework. After all, if there’s one thing that’s certain about gardens, it’s that they are forever changing.;                        Main Address:;         Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens;         P.O.
