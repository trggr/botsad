9-">The upland forest restoration work of Brackenhurst Botanic Garden near Nairobi, Kenya, is the most diverse example of forest restoration in Kenya and has become a model for East African habitat restoration initiatives. One hundred acres (40 hectares) of tropical rainforest have now been replanted. In just 15 years, the project has replaced exotic tree plantations with a 30-foot tall native forest that shelters lianas, orchids and a species-rich understory. More than 500 East African woody species, including 25 threatened species, have been incorporated in restoration plots and the compound of Brackenhurst Conference Centre. The forest is now home to over 170 species of birds, 120 species of butterfly, as well as fruit bats. The project also provides livelihood opportunities in an area of high unemployment, by training and employing local people. <img style="display: block
