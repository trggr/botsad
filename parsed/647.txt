Its history is rich, with ancient Native American sites, the home of the original Oregon State Forest Nursery, as well as the site of a Civilian Conservation Corp camp in the 1930's. Currently, the Arboretum houses the College Forest field office and staff. Arboretum maintenance is funded entirely by the College of Forestry from revenues derived from sale of timber by the College Forests.;                        Main Address:;         Peavy Arboretum;         College of Forestry, Oregon State University;                Corvallis;        Oregon 97331 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (541) 737-6702;         Fax: ;         URL: https://cf.forestry.oregonstate.edu/our-forests/arboretum;         Primary Email: carli.morgan@oregonstate.edu       ;
