The landscape of the estate is in the Picturesque style, set round the ruins of a 14th-century moated castle. Rhododendrons and Azaleas flower in profusion, with wisteria and roses rambling over the stonework. Features include the Quarry Garden, which is home to many types of fern and heavily scented Ghent azaleas in shades of orange, yellow and cream. The moat, which surrounds the old castle, has along its edge water-loving plants such as yellow iris, rodgersia and kingcups. On the north-west side of the moat is the thatched Ice-House. On Pear Tree Island, an isthmus, is a three-piece bronze reclining figure by Henry Moore. Wonderful views and beautiful woodland and estate walks.;                        Main Address:;         Scotney Castle;         Lamberhurst;                Tunbridge Wells;        Kent TN3 8JN United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/scotney-castle/;         Primary Email:        ;
