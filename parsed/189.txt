Established in 1874, the Garden's Victorian past is evident in its magnificent specimens of northern hemisphere plants, such as the swamp cypress, tulip trees, camphor trees, plane trees, giant figs and magnolias. One of the finest features of the Garden is the avenue of London plane trees, which has been stunning visitors since 1908. Take a virtual tour of the Garden to see its highlights, or visit it season by season.;  ;  The focus of the Garden is to collect, display and promote the conservation of plants of the eastern grasslands, in particular the genera Kniphofia, Watsonia and Dierama. ;  ;  A section of the Garden is planted specifically to attract birds which, along with other diverse habitats, makes the Garden rich in bird life, with over 180 species recorded.;                        Main Address:;         KwaZulu-Natal National Botanical Garden;         South African National Biodiversity Institute;        P.O.Box 21667, Mayors Walk;        Pietermaritzburg;        KwaZulu-Natal 3208 South Africa;        ;                 Telephone: +27 (0) 33 344 3585;         Fax: +27 (0) 33 344 1284;         URL: www.sanbi.org;         Primary Email: s.zondi@sanbi.org.za       ;
