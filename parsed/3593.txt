Info:	  United States of America - Oklahoma - Oklahoma City  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: OHOMA; International Agenda Registration: Yes; BGCI Member: Yes; About the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden The botanical garden at the Oklahoma City Zoo was established in 1998 through the American Association of Museums accreditation process creating the botanical garden and a living museum. The botanical collecting began in 1980 with over 6,000 permanent specimens from nearly 150 plant families, including over 2,000 species and 23 designated horticultural collections. The botanical garden at the Oklahoma City Zoo encompasses 160 acres of tree canopy, gardens, water bodies, and animal exhibits. This unique and distinctive environment is characterized by the ancient and historic Cross Timbers ecosystem. This ecotone is described as where the eastern Oklahoma deciduous forest meets the mixed grass prairie of western Oklahoma. Stands of Post Oak (Quercus stellata) and Blackjack Oak (Quercus marilandica) form a dense canopy across the gardens. Many fragments of the historic Cross Timber ecosystem can be seen in ancient pockets of Post Oak groves scattered throughout the gardens. Many champion Oak trees live in the gardens and several are well over 100 years old.;  Main Address:; Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden; 2101 NE 50TH ST.; Oklahoma City; Oklahoma 73111 United States of America; ;  Telephone: (405) 425-0247; Fax: (405) 425-0215; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.okczoo.org">www.okczoo.org; Primary Email: lswearengin@okczoo.org ;
