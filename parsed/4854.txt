Restored from dereliction by the Trust from 1967, using detailed accounts and contemporary bird's-eye view by Johannes Kip. The majority of plants now grown were available to the original owner. Good collection of espaliered apples and pears with 17th-century species chosen such as 'Catshead' and 'Bellisime d'Hiver'. Four-hundred-year-old Holm oak and reputedly the tallest Tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) in Britain. Formal parterre with topiary and historical planting gives good displays in summer. Walled flower garden provides colour all summer long. Picnic area planted with daffodils, snowdrops and wild flowers, providing a haven for wildlife.;                        Main Address:;         Westbury Court Garden;                         Westbury-on-severn;        Gloucestershire GL14 1PD United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/westbury-court-garden/;         Primary Email:        ;
