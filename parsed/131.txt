9-">In addition, over 600ha of species-rich native woodland and shrubland communities are under active restoration in Kings Park and associated lands. Kings Park is involved in over 70 restoration projects, mostly in degraded landscapes in the arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean-climate areas of Western Australia, but also local- to regional-scale restoration projects in the Middle East and North Africa. These projects occur in ecosystems as diverse as Western Australian marine seagrass meadows, species-rich Kwongan shrublands and arid spinifex grasslands, and Libyan juniper woodlands. <p style="text-align: justify
