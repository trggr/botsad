9-">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew is working with local people, government and industry to re-establish hyperarid woodlands in southern Peru. For more than five years, school children and their parents have learned about the importance of the native huarango tree to their own economic well-being, and have become major partners in re-establishing the woodlands and conserving remnant stands of native vegetation. <p style="text-align: justify
9-">They have propagated tens of thousands of native trees, shrubs and herbs and the new woodland is over one kilometre long. <img style="display: block
