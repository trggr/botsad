Info:	  United States of America - New York - Esperance  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: GLARB; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Landis Arboretum The Landis Arboretum is a public garden overlooking historic Schoharie Valley near Esperance, New York. The Arboretum's 548-acre site stretches easily into both Schoharie and Montgomery Counties. Forty acres are developed with plantings of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous perennials from around the world. The remainder of the property consists of natural areas, woodlands, wetlands, more than 8 miles of trails, and open fields reminiscent of the former Oak Nose Farm, homestead of founder Fred Lape. ; Among the Arboretum's horticultural features are its collections of notable trees, flowering ornamental trees and shrubs, tough trees for tough sites, conifers, and oaks. Two old growth forests and additional natural areas representing various stages of succession await visitors The Van Loveland Perennial Garden at the old farm house and the recently restored Quarry Garden are seasonal favorites.; Like the venerable 500-year-old Great Oak that captures the sight and imagination of every visitor to the Lape Estate, the Arboretum itself is a mighty oak evolved from an acorn of inspiration and nurtured by passionate people united in their love and respect for nature. Interpretive signage aids visitors in their enjoyment and understanding of the collections and ecosystems of the Arboretum â€“ while they delight in the sweeping vistas of the countryside.;  Main Address:; Landis Arboretum; 174 Lape Road; P.O.
