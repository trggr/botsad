Founded in 2001, the Garden is currently in its early stages of development and the public is encouraged to visit as the garden grows!;  ;  The existing landscape includes 20 acres of rolling hills, spring-fed ponds, sandstone outcroppings, and a ravine. Over the past several years, many native and exotic perennials, trees, and shrubs have been added to the landscape. The first phase of the Rose Garden is complete and an amphitheater has been built into the hillside of a ravine. We also added a ½ mile trail in the Woodlands that lets visitors meander through sandstones.;  ;  Clary Gardens is great place for families to get out and enjoy nature…..so come visit and see what’s new!;                        Main Address:;         Clary Gardens;         588 West Chestnut Street;                Coshocton;        Ohio 43812 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (740) 622-6524;         Fax: (614) 283-9210;         URL: www.clarygardens.org;         Primary Email: info@ClaryGardens.org       ;
