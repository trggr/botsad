MUN Botanical Garden conservation efforts include the maintenance of ex situ population of three rare, endemic Newfoundland plants:	Salix jejuna, Braya longii and Braya fernaldii. These plants are listed by COSEWIC. We have maintained an ex situ population of these plants for 10 years now (as of 2017). We have also collected braya seed in the past and sent them to the Canadian seed bank in Saskatchewan. Willow seed have short viability so we have no choice but to maintain living material. We have willow and braya from most of the known Newfoundland populations so our gene pool is as diverse as possible.
