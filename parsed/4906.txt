Canton is approximately 40 miles north of Atlanta in the foothills of the Piedmont Range.  Numbering over 4,000 living specimens, the plantings display one of the largest private collections of temperate flora in the  United States.  With an elevation of 1200 feet and containing several lakes and streams,  we are able to grow a wide variety of plants in our zone 7B climate.  The property is also bounded by several large wetland habitats where many migratory and native fowl make their home.  It is situated on 13 acres in the middle of an old-growth southern deciduous hardwood forest, containing many large Oaks, Hickory, Poplar and Sweetgum--some of which are over 100 years old;                        Main Address:;         Cox Arboretum & Gardens;         1621 N.
