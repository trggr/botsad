The Institute's garden was established by Congress in 1820 to the west of the Capitol Grounds, extending from First Street to Third Street between Pennsylvania and Maryland Avenues. This facility functioned until shortly after the organization stopped holding meetings in 1837. ;  ;  In 1842, the idea of a national botanic garden was reestablished when the return of the United States Exploring Expedition to the South Seas (the Wilkes Expedition) brought to Washington a collection of living plants from around the globe. Placed initially in a specially constructed greenhouse behind the Old Patent Office Building, the plants were moved in late 1850 into a new structure on the site previously occupied by the Columbian Institute's garden.;  ;  The Garden was moved to its present location in 1933. The complex is bordered by First Street and Third Streets, S.W., and located along the north and south sides of Independence Avenue. The Garden includes the Conservatory and two acres of surrounding exterior grounds, the outdoor display gardens in Frederic Auguste Bartholdi Park surrounding Bartholdi Fountain and the three acre National Garden directly west of the Conservatory. A plant production and support facility moved to the present location in 1993 and includes 25 acres of growing space, 85,000 sg ft of greenhouses and maintenance shops.;  ;  Under the direction of the Joint Committee on the Library (Legislative Branch of the US Federal Government), which is charged by law with control over the USBG, the Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Garden.;                        Main Address:;         United States Botanic Garden;         245 First Street, SW;                Washington;        District of Columbia 20024 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (202) 226-8333;         Fax: (202) 225-1561;         URL: www.usbg.gov;         Primary Email: rmims@aoc.gov       ;
