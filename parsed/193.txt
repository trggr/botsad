Begun in 1931, the Garden has grown through the years and now encompasses a collection of more than 1500 native species and cultivars of which 150 are rare and endangered. Located 20 miles west of Boston, from April and May’s spring ephemerals to summer’s blooming meadow through October’s fiery foliage, the Garden displays an ever-changing tapestry of flowers and foliage. ;  ;   ;  ;  Founded in 1900, New England Wild Flower Society is the oldest plant conservation organization in the United States. Through our leadership, the Society protects native plants and their habitats with the goal of ensuring that they will exist in vigorous populations within healthy, evolving ecosystems and of engaging a broad range of people to actively promote and protect them in the wild and in their gardens.;                        Main Address:;         Native Plant Trust - Garden in the Woods;         180 Hemenway Road;                Framingham;        Massachusetts 01701-2699 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (508) 877-7630;         Fax: (508) 877-3658;         URL: www.nativeplanttrust.org;         Primary Email: information@NativePlantTrust.org       ;
