It was founded in 1937 by a Dr Fox who's philosophy was painting with trees and shrubs'. He did this through massed plantings of key species in a way that compliments the natural beauty of the valley and the Surrey Hills countryside beyond. It was gifted to the National Trust in 1952  Its 110 acres afford spectacular spring and autumn colours from rare trees and shrubs laid out in group plantings. In April the slopes turn into blue mists of bluebells. One of the finest collections of Sorbus in the country. Walking along the paths that lead through the trees affords excellent views as the sun strikes through the autumn-tinted foliage or lights up the coloured fruits. Good use of Blue Atlas Cedar to enhance the spring and autumn colours. Interesting fungi in autumn.;                        Main Address:;         Winkworth Arboretum;         Hascombe Road;                Godalming;        Surrey GU8 4AD United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 01483 208477;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/winkworth-arboretum/;         Primary Email: winkwortharboretum@nationaltrust.org.uk       ;
