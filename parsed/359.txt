Also of importance, the natural surrounding is far away from the disturbing influence of the city.;   The Garden is under continuous development, new expositions are emerging. This may be the reason of imaginary disconnection of the whole area of the Garden. So called "Southern Grounds" is especially worth of seeing because of its open space exhibition with Japanese garden and St. Claire´s Vineyard, "Northern Grounds" are inviting visitors to see another open space exhibition with Peony meadow and a collection of frost-hard cacti, nicknamed "Mexico".;                        Main Address:;         Prague Botanic Garden / Botanicka Zahrada Praha;         Trojska 800/196;                Prague;        Troja 171 00 Czech Republic;        ;                 Telephone: +420 234 148 111;         Fax: +420 233 542 629;         URL: www.botanicka.cz;         Primary Email: info@botanicka.cz       ;
