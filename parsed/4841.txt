Sweeping lawns around the house give way to a network of paths leading the visitor through the different areas of the garden. A formal lime avenue, about 80 metres long, is underplanted with narcissus. In late summer Cyclamen hederifolium carpet the ground. Rhododendrons, camellias and hydrangeas provide bold colour amongst the shrubberies, which give shelter to many interesting plants, including tender species from the southern hemisphere. Likewise the orange grove, hidden behind the chapel, offers shelter to tubs of citrus and agapanthus, giving a Mediterranean flavour. A herbaceous border designed by Graham Stuart Thomas offers additional summer colour. Abundant areas of wild flowers from spring to midsummer. Many fine specimen trees, notably pines and acers. The magnificent 18th-century orangery, Gothic castle and Fanny's Bower provide architectural and historical interest.;                        Main Address:;         Saltram;         Plympton;                Plymouth;        Devon PL7 1UH United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/saltram/;         Primary Email:        ;
