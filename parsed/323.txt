Stevenson. It was originally started as an experimental farm to conduct research and demonstrate to farmers better methods of growing their crops and the use of trees and shrubs to beautify and protect their land. The location was selected because of our long growing season, notably the greatest number of frost free days on the prairies.;  ;  The Morden Research Centre specializes in developing improved varieties, production and protection practices to enhance the marketability of ornamentals, flax, field peas and beans for the prairie region.;  ;  The Centre is one of 18 establishments in Canada directed by the Research Branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. It comprises a land base of 254 hectares, a 5,100 m2 office and laboratory complex opened in 1989, and a staff of twenty-six A-base funded personnel.;  ;  The Centre has a state-of-the-art quarantine flax rust laboratory and a large Arboretum containing more than 3,000 different woody ornamentals on 26 hectares. The Centre's scientists and biologists are trained and experienced in plant breeding, plant pathology, plant physiology, and agronomy.;                        Main Address:;         Morden Arboretum Research Station;         Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Station;        100-101 Route 100, P.O.
