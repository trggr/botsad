Our mission is the preservation and promotion of the native plant species and habitats of these mountains. We hope to increase public awareness of this regionâ€™s unique botanical diversity by maintaining gardens for the enjoyment of the public and by providing educational programs and research resources for the community. The Cole Library of The Botanical Gardens at Asheville contains more than 1000 books relating to botany, horticulture, ecology, and ornithology.;  ;  The grounds of BGA are open year round from sunrise to sunset for the enjoyment of the community, and no admission is charged for entrance. ;  ;  The Botanical Gardens is an independent nonprofit corporation financially supported by memberships, donations, endowments, proceeds from the Garden Path Gift Shop, and fees from special events and programs that are offered to the public. With the exception of the occasional competitive grant, we receive no city, state, or federal tax dollars. Although the Gardens is located on land belonging to the adjacent University of North Carolina at Asheville, we operate independently and are overseen by a Board of Directors elected from and by the general membership of the Botanical Gardens.;                        Main Address:;         Botanical Gardens at Asheville, The;         151 W.T.
