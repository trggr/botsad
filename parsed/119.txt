The spacious green area with the old park, picturesque ponds and several buildings of the former estate of Juozapas Godlevskis (Aukštosios Fredos's estate) was provided for establishing VMUBG at that time. Professor Konstantin Regel from Tartu University was invited to direct VMUBG. The detailed project for the VMUBG landscape was made in 1924 by architect Karol Rauth from Hanover. With the help of other Botanical gardens, especially Berlin’s Dahlem, Konigsberg and St. Petersburg’s Kaunas Botanical Garden built up very rapidly. The construction of the Greenhouse was finished in 1938.;  Presently, VMUBG occupies the area of 62.5 ha close to the city centre. VMUBG is a multifunctional botanical garden that consists of three departments: Science, Expositions and Collections, and Service and Education. The Science department is comprised of three sectors (Medicinal and Spice Plants, Dendrology and Phytopathology, and Pomology). Department of Expositions and Collections includes sectors of Plant systematics, Floriculture and Greenhouse.;  The unique feature of this garden is a peaceful and green environment created by an advantageous combination of cultural and natural heritage. Botanical expositions and collections, the Greenhouse, big landscape park with an interesting pond system – this is not the only place for plant conservation and research but also the area for all modern forms of interactive education, cultural tourism and community use. VMUBG carries out various educational and public engagement activities as well as implements a popular interactive program for informal education and science communication. VMUBG accepts more than 90 thousand visitors per year.;                        Main Address:;         Vytautas Magnus University Botanical Garden in Kaunas;                 Ž. E.
