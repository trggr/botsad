10-">Grassy woodland ecosystems are amongst the most degraded and fragmented landscapes in SE Australia. In western Sydney, the critically endangered Cumberland Plain Woodland (CPW) grassy understorey diversity is quickly lost due to invasion by woody weeds such as African olive. At the Australian Botanic Garden, a native grass seed production area has proven to be a highly effective source of seed for landscape scale restoration via direct seeding, following the mechanical control of dense African olive forests. <p style="text-align: justify

10-">Long lived woody weeds such as African olive (<em>Olea europaea</em> ssp. <em>cuspidata</em>) have invaded bushland at a landscape scale in south west Sydney, forming dense monocultures and shading out the native grassy understorey. Following broad scale mechanical control of dense African olive, the re-establishment of locally occurring native grasses is a vital first step in ecological restoration. At the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan (ABGMA) a 1500 sq metre native grass seed production area has been established to provide seed, specifically for the restoration of cleared African olive sites. Grass seed output from the first 2014/15 summer season resulted in 118kg of seed material harvested, and a total output of over 13 million viable seeds. <p style="text-align: center
