Much of the formal 17th- and early 18th-century garden was swept away by William Emes in the 1760s. Today the garden has several different areas: a formal garden with topiary, small herbaceous border and rose garden, shrub garden with herbaceous beds and rare shrubs, rhododendrons, azaleas and hydrangeas, a fine larch and Davidia involucrata (Handkerchief tree). There is also a small pond with fish and Emperor dragonflies. The hawk house that once housed Lord Howard de Walden's birds now provides shelter from the elements for visitors. Behind the hawk house lies the rockery with many alpine and sun-loving plants. A terrace leads to a pavilion by Emes and also the lime tree avenue. While this garden is finest in spring, there is much summer interest, in particular a fine rockery.;                        Main Address:;         Chirk Castle;         Chirk;                Wrexham;        Clwyd LL14 5AF United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/chirk-castle/;         Primary Email:        ;
