Special Collections:	Most of our collection is related to the plants grown in the city of Aalsmeer from 1650 until 1960. So we have a wide variety of schrubs, conifers,fruittrees and oldfashioned indoor plants. But the roses were very important in older days,that's why there is a important collection of cut roses, also we have a large number of lilac's and the Dahlia's are related to the growers on our location.
