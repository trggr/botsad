Info:	  Jordan - Amman  ;Garden Information;<a href="#tabs-3">Restoration Projects;  Institution Code: JARBG; International Agenda Registration: Yes; BGCI Member: Yes; About the Royal Botanic Garden The Royal Botanic Garden of Jordan is a non-profit organization, founded in 2005.The RBG envisions a society where there is no longer a need for plant conservation. The Mission of the RBG is to ensure native flora conservation through ecological restoration and providing a research and demonstration site to address the environmental challenges of our times and generating hope for the future.; ; The RBG is located in Tal Al-Rumman, just north of Amman, overlooking King Talal Dam. The Botanic Garden covers 1,800 dunums (180 hectares), with more than 300 m of elevation change within its boundaries and a variety of soil types, allowing for the possibility of hosting a high percentage of the plant species that grow naturally in Jordan.; ; The RBG ethos is to practice and advocate plant diversity conservation at the whole-systems level.; ; Two key premises guide our work. The first is habitat-based conservation, such that we consider all biogeographic conditions, the complete watershed area, soil condition and exposure to the elements.; ; The second premise is that man is an integral part of the biotic whole. In contrast to many conservation approaches, the RBG does not exclude humans and livestock.; ; The Garden is intended to function as a giant demonstration site, showcasing sustainable water management, energy strategies, grazing, and environmentally compatible income generation. Every strategy used at the RBG should be replicable by the average Jordanian.; ; Our work is divided into three main components:; ; 1. Science and Conservation; The RBG became an internationally recognized research facility for all aspects of biodiversity and conservation in arid-land environments. ; ; 2. Education and Community Development; We are raising awareness and disseminating the results of our research on Jordanâ€™s biodiversity to the public, while encouraging nature-related projects in local communities.; ; 3. Sustainable Living; In addition to its botanical components, the Royal Botanic Garden will be a demonstration site for sustainable land use, water harvesting practices, and eco-living.;  Main Address:; Royal Botanic Garden; P.O.
