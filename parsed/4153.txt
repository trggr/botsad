The Mission of the RBG is to ensure native flora conservation through ecological restoration and providing a research and demonstration site to address the environmental challenges of our times and generating hope for the future.;  ;  The RBG is located in Tal Al-Rumman, just north of Amman, overlooking King Talal Dam. The Botanic Garden covers 1,800 dunums (180 hectares), with more than 300 m of elevation change within its boundaries and a variety of soil types, allowing for the possibility of hosting a high percentage of the plant species that grow naturally in Jordan.;  ;  The RBG ethos is to practice and advocate plant diversity conservation at the whole-systems level.;  ;  Two key premises guide our work. The first is habitat-based conservation, such that we consider all biogeographic conditions, the complete watershed area, soil condition and exposure to the elements.;  ;  The second premise is that man is an integral part of the biotic whole. In contrast to many conservation approaches, the RBG does not exclude humans and livestock.;  ;  The Garden is intended to function as a giant demonstration site, showcasing sustainable water management, energy strategies, grazing, and environmentally compatible income generation. Every strategy used at the RBG should be replicable by the average Jordanian.;  ;  Our work is divided into three main components:;  ;   1. Science and Conservation;  The RBG became an internationally recognized research facility for all aspects of biodiversity and conservation in arid-land environments. ;  ;  2. Education and Community Development;  We are raising awareness and disseminating the results of our research on Jordanâ€™s biodiversity to the public, while encouraging nature-related projects in local communities.;  ;  3. Sustainable Living;  In addition to its botanical components, the Royal Botanic Garden will be a demonstration site for sustainable land use, water harvesting practices, and eco-living.;                        Main Address:;         Royal Botanic Garden;         P.O.

8-">Within RBG, they are also developing a premaculture-based demonstration site, as part of an EU-funded project called SIDIG-MED. The project aims to restore a large tract of arid land and turn it into a productive area that teaches practical, replicable skills to local community members. Project components include growing food and useful native plants, beekeeping, natural buildings, water harvesting, solar energy and food processing techniques, among other things. As they participate, local people are earning money, learning sustainable living techniques, and becoming more aware of the need to restore the environment. <img style="display: block
8-As part of the project, local families are also learning how to earn income from sources other than herding. A dozen families have been trained to produce bee products, sun-dried yoghurt (jameed) and mushrooms. Furthermore, local women have been taught sewing and handicraft skills, which empowers them by attaining new skills. The CBRR is successfully improving the livelihood of sheep and goat herders and improving family hygiene, which has greatly decreased illness among the community. The multi-faceted activities of the CBRR have brought higher and diversified incomes for local livestock owners, community mobilization, and greater understanding of sustainable land management practices, all of which are key to achieving enhanced food security locally and throughout the country. <p style="text-align: justify
