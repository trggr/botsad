It has a typical romantic design with alternating large tree clusters, lawns and water features. The castle ruin (1790), visible from various sites, dominates the landscape. Renovation of the castle started in september 2004. The total area is more than 24 ha of which 13 form the arboretum; the remaining grounds comprise a nature garden, fruit orchard, agricultural field and a little brook. The arboretum was founded by the Decalut family in 1980. Nowadays the arboretum is managed by the commune of Beveren.;  ;  It now comprises more than 4500 plants including 70 Quercus spp., varieties and cultivars, more than 62 Ilex spp., 88 Viburnum spp., and 54 Cornus spp.. The soil belongs to the Fago-quercetum association which is perfect for oak, beech, chestnut, European aspen, birch, honeysuckle, rowan, hazel-nut, bird-cherry and holly. The focus of the park is on educating the broad public with respect to flora and the natural environment. The most striking trees in the collection are the giant copper beeches.Some of them had to be cut down in january 2006 because of parasits (fungi). Some eye-catching rare species include Betula medwediewii, Betula papyrifera or Betula turkestanica (2 m dwarf form). Also of note are a gigantic Thuja plicata, an old white mulberry, Ailanthus vilmoriniana, a deep purple Magnolia liliflora Nigra, and an old Catalpa bignonioides amongst others.;  ;  The arboretum is bordered by a small forest dominated by chestnut trees with accompanying undergrowth shrubs, herbaceous plants and ferns. In this part we find an old ice-house that is presently a shelter for bats. Another attraction of the park is its wealth of birds. Guided tours are organised on request on the opening days. A small information folder is available, educational brochures, exhibitions and various other activities are regularly organised.;                        Main Address:;         Hof ter Saksen Arboretum;         Hof ter Saksen, Haasdonkbaan 101, B-9120 Beveren;                Beveren;        Belgium;        ;                 Telephone: 32 (0)3 750 18 60         32 (0)3 760 18 66;         Fax: ;         URL: www.beveren.be;         Primary Email: Natuurontwikkeling@beveren.be       ;
