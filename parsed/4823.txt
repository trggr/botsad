From the terrace in front of the Hall, the garden and lawns slope down to the River Manifold and the village church. Within the park are "boil holes", where the rivers Manifold and Hamps resurface after travelling underground, one of the largest resurgences in the country. A path leads from the boil holes along Paradise Walk, which is maintained as a landscaped promenade feature of the park. From here one can view the ancient Hinkley Wood, of great interest to ecologists for its native populations of two rare trees, small- and large-leaved limes, and hybrids between them. Ash regeneration is now filling the many gaps left by the demise of the elm. Standing deadwood has been left where possible for insect and bird interest.
