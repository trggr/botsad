Workshops and educational courses:	We offer a large variety of workshops and educational courses to visitors and students on the commercial uses of plants such as medicinal plant preparations, essential oil extraction, alcohol tinctures, food dehydration, natural colorant extraction, preparation of plant-based fungicides, insecticides, and repellents, worm composting, organic fertilizers, mushroom cultivation, tree grafting, orchid growing and farm to table cooking, among others. We are currently setting up an online course platform to continue educating and sharing our knowledge about plants and their uses.
