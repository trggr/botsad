The broad lawns, trees and colourful seasonal flowers attract hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. ;  ;  The Gardens represent a European landscaping tradition, orderly and meticulous. They integrate cultivated with uncultivated spaces, and foreign with indigenous Israeli-Mediterranean vegetation. The Memorial Gardens are comprised of several smaller, specialized gardens including the Cascade Garden, Rose Garden, Palm Garden and Fragrance Garden. Over 30 varieties of trees provide shade, while spacious lawns and seasonal flowers offer a feast for the eyes. The Fragrance Garden provides a unique and rich experience for the partially and totally blind. Most paths are accessible to the disabled and handicapped.;                        Main Address:;         Ramat Hanadiv Memorial Gardens and Nature Park;         POB 325, Zikhron Yaakov;                Zikhron Yaakov;        30900 Israel;        ;                 Telephone: +972-4-6298110;         Fax: +972-4-6399117;         URL: http://www.ramat-hanadiv.org.il/;         Primary Email: racheli@ramathanadiv.org.il       ;
