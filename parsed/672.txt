Info:	  United States of America - Pennsylvania - Media  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Tyler Arboretum Tyler Arboretum is a 650-acre property located just outside Media, Pennsylvania. Between 1681 and 1944, the property was home to eight generations of the Minshall/Painter/Tyler family. In 1944, the last descendent bequeathed the property to the public as an arboretum. The present-day arboretum originated as the private collection of two brothers who in 1825 started planting more than 1,000 varieties of trees and shrubs. Over 20 of the original trees planted by the Painter brothers still survive. Open year round, with 20 miles of hiking trails, Tyler provides a natural sanctuary for families, bird enthusiasts, hikers and visitors interested in history and horticulture. The Arboretumâ€™s collections include rare plant specimens, ancient trees and historic buildings.;  Main Address:; Tyler Arboretum; 515 Painter Road; Media; Pennsylvania 19063 United States of America; ;  Telephone: (610) 566-9134; Fax: (610) 891-1490; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tylerarboretum.org">www.tylerarboretum.org; Primary Email: info@tylerarboretum.org ;
