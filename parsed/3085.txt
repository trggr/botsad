Furthermore, the Garden had to supply the Brera “Pharmacy” with medicinal plants. The project was committed to Father Fulgenzio Vitman, who had already planned a large university Botanical Garden in Pavia.; Today the Brera Botanical Garden is part of the Brera Botanical Garden, a museum managed by the Università degli Studi di Milano (Department of Biosciences)and recognized by the Lombardy Region. The Museum’s aim is the safeguard of Palazzo Brera’s historical-scientific and historical-naturalistic heritage. The promotion and realisation of projects and activities of recovering and conservation directed not only to the preservation of the historical heritage but also the dissemination of scientific culture had been put into action by the Università degli Studi di Milano since the early 80’s. That is why the Brera Botanical Garden welcomes school classes and groups of adults every day.;  Main Address:; Orto Botanico di Brera - Università degli Studi di Milano; Via Brera, 28; Secondary entrance Via F.lli Gabba, 10; Milano; Lombardia 20121 Italy; ;  Telephone: +39 0250314683; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.museoortibotanicistatale.it">www.museoortibotanicistatale.it; Primary Email: ortobotanicodibrera@unimi.it ;
