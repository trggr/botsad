People and Governments can take cognisance and show cooperative response. Gardening, a seemingly simple chore, if consistently applied over decades can heal the beaten landscape. This planet our home can be nurtured back. Children to whom the Earth belongs can be made to appreciate this splendid phenomenon and be a part of this nurturing process at the Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary.;  ;  The Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary is tucked away in the far away hills of the Wayanad forests of Kerala. It sits perched on a hillock by a perennial stream that flows all the way into the Bay of Bengal.;  ;  The Sanctuary is a patch of 50 acres of forests land of which some 40 acres are left largely alone for natural succession. About 5 acres is meticulously tended and doubles as a showcase for visitors to visit, explore, interrogate and comprehend. The Gurukula tends its forests on the principles of restoration ecology with careful, conscious human interference. Form the mosses, liverworts, ferns, orchids, lichens to the massive angiosperms, each one is documented, catalogued, tended and known by nature, place, origin, age and stage.;  ;  A small group of six individuals live and work at the sanctuary and are collectively responsible for the place. It has grown into an informal centre for botanical research, forest department's collaborative conservation efforts and a space for children to gleam into the mysteries of what constitutes the living earth.;                        Main Address:;         Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary;         Alattil P.O.;                North Wayanad;        Kerala 670644 India;        ;                 Telephone: ;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.gbsanctuary.org/;         Primary Email: gbsanctuary@vsnl.net       ;
