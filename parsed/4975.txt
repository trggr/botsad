4-Special Collections: The gardens feature plants of the South East Queensland bioregion, particularly those found on the Sunshine Coast. This area includes parts of the Southeast Hills and Ranges, Gympie Block, Southern Coastal Lowlands and Great Sandy sub-bioregions. An ecological system of planting is followed (a method of using living plants from that particular area) with the existing plants and trees and land features of the gardens guiding the selection and location of new planting. Over 400 species of plants were found on the gardenâ€™s site before the gardens were developed.
