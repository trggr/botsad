Satellite Garden Names:	Truby King Park. This park, once the house and garden of Sir Truby and Lady Isabella King, Plunket Society co-founders, is a 1.9 hectare heritage-listed estate. Designed by prominent local architect Gray Young, the 1923 house has New Zealand Historic Places Trust and Wellington City Council heritage listings. The house and garden were originally known as ‘Mount Melrose’. The remainder of the estate, including the former Karitane Products Society factory and Karitane Hospital, is now owned privately. Truby King was an avid gardener in later life, planting many pines, rhododendrons, azaleas and roses, and building elaborate brickwork structures
