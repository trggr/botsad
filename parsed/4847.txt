Attractions include the famous Japanese Garden which underwent large-scale restoration during 2001 with funding from the Japanese Exposition Fund and the National Trust. Extensive research by Professor Fukuhara of Osaka University and the existence of glass-plate photographic records have enabled the garden to be restored to its original 1910 design. The restoration of the Walled Garden began in December 2000, a project that will provide a number of new facilities as well as restoring fig, tomato, orchid and pot-plant houses.;                        Main Address:;         Tatton Park;                         Knutsford;        Cheshire WA16 6QN United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tatton-park/;         Primary Email:        ;
