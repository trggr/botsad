Attractions include the famous Japanese Garden which underwent large-scale restoration during 2001 with funding from the Japanese Exposition Fund and the National Trust. Extensive research by Professor Fukuhara of Osaka University and the existence of glass-plate photographic records have enabled the garden to be restored to its original 1910 design. The restoration of the Walled Garden began in December 2000, a project that will provide a number of new facilities as well as restoring fig, tomato, orchid and pot-plant houses.;  Main Address:; Tatton Park; Knutsford; Cheshire WA16 6QN United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tatton-park/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tatton-park/; Primary Email: ;
