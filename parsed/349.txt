There were mostly taxa important for agriculture. Garden was unfortunately confined to the extent and number of taxa. However it was part of University what was big advantage.;  In 1938 was founded close to this garden woody plants collection - arboretum, intended for forest engineers. The founder was Prof. Ing. Dr. Augustin Bayer who plant 1 ha area in a distance of 500 m from University.;  Old garden and arboretum stayed unchanged during 2nd World War to the sixties. Together with growing importance of University was necessary to build new buildings. Botanical Garden had to step aside. Therefore it was important to create new one. For this purpose was chosen about 10 ha area in close proximity to Bayer's arboretum.;  In 1967 started first arrangements and in 1970 building of new botanic garden and arboretum as a scientific, research and educational part of University.;                        Main Address:;         Botanical Gardens and Arboretum;         Mendel University in Brno;        Zemedelska 1;        Brno;        613 00 Czech Republic;        ;                 Telephone: +420 5 45 22 36 06;         Fax: +420 5 45 22 36 93;         URL: www.mendelu.cz/arboretum;         Primary Email: arboretum@mendelu.cz       ;
