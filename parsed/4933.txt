Info:	  Canada - Saskatchewan - Regina  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Government House Edwardian Gardens Long-time landscape gardener, George Watt, envisioned the grounds of Government House to be a type of oasis against the treeless prairie terrain. In the early 1900s his vision, following the Edwardian design popular at the time, was realized. It is based on the concept of creating "outdoor rooms". This splendour of the Edwardian Gardens has been reÂ¬born after the 8.5 acre area underwent a major facelift in 2009-10. The rehabilitation re-establishes and builds on the grounds' original features with new elements such as a hedge maze and event area with a portable stage. It also includes water-efficient irrigation and lighting systems, and hard surfaced, well-lit walkways that are barrier-free and will facilitate easy snow removal in the winter months.; ; Immerse yourself in an oasis of trees and flowers, exploring each uniquely-themed garden. Whether enjoying a quiet picnic or outdoor event, partaking in a garden tour or simply taking in the serene setting, our gardens are the perfect way to spend the day.;  Main Address:; Government House Edwardian Gardens; 4607 Dewdney Avenue; Regina; Saskatchewan S4T 1B7 Canada; ;  Telephone: (306) 787-5773; Fax: (306) 787-5714; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governmenthouse.gov.sk.ca/EdwardianGardens">http://www.governmenthouse.gov.sk.ca/EdwardianGardens; Primary Email: governmenthouse@gov.sk.ca ;
