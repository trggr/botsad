The site extends inland from the sea to a plateau providing a range of planting environments and is one of a few botanic gardens in the world which has marine and estuarine plants naturally in its grounds.;  ;  The location of the gardens is within the Fannie Bay cultural and recreational precinct and places it amongst primary tourist venues.
