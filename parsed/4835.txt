Info:	  United Kingdom - Devon - Salcombe  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Overbeck's Otto Overbeck created a Mediterranean garden on a magnificent site overlooking the Salcombe Estuary. In a letter written in 1933, he rhapsodised "It is so warm and beautiful here. I grow Bananas, Oranges, and Pomegranates in the open garden, and have 3,000 palm trees, planted out in my woods and garden". Informal and adventurous in spirit, the garden is a blaze of colour in summer - in particular in July and August - with beds combining herbaceous plants with pots and urns containing agaves. Unlike many West Country gardens, Overbecks does not rely on rhododendrons and camellias because of the alkaline soil. Instead, the old and famous Magnolia campbellii 'Overbeck's' provides a wonderful sight in early spring.;  Main Address:; Overbeck's; Sharpitor; Salcombe; Devon TQ8 8LW.
