In 1899, during the Governorship of His Excellency Sir W. Brandford-Griffith K.G.M.G., a few hectares of land was cleared in vicinity of the sanatorium to begin the Botanic Deparment.;  ;  The clearing was done under the supervision of a German serving the Basel Mission. In 1890 Mr. William Crowther, a student from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew arrived in the Gold Coast(now Ghana) as the first curator of the botanic garden.;                        Main Address:;         Aburi Botanic Gardens;         PO Box 23, ABURI, Akwiapim, Ghana.;        P.O.Box  M169  Accra Ghana;        Aburi;        Ghana;        ;                 Telephone: 233 2176 4337;         Fax: 233 2177 7821;         URL: ;         Primary Email:        ;
