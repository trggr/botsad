Satellite Garden Names:	Alpine Garden on Mount Patscherkofel <br> On Mt.Patscherkofel, the mountain arising direct in the south of the city of Innsbruck, the Alpine Garden of the University of Innsbruck was reopened to the public in the autumn of 1994. This Alpine Garden is the highest located Botanical Garden in Austria and was founded in 1930 by the Leopold-Franzens University Innsbruck. A new, modern research station within the garden enables Botanists all year round to carry out their studies directly in the field. The 1 hectare (= 2.470 acres) large garden is situated at 2000m above sea near the top station of the Patscherkofel cable car and therefore fast and easily reached. The garden is fenced since 1930 and a lot of plants could maintain here, which were otherwise superseded by the lot of grazing cattle. The favorable position of the garden, situated within the timberline, enables us to show different plant communities naturally occurring here. A new trail leading through the steep area allows the visitors a close view to the communities such as timberline forests, elfin wood/ Krummholz, tall alpine herbfield or alpine tundra associations. Only the understanding of the sensitive balance can help to save this endangered communities. In addition we also want to show plants from other alpine regions of the world.
