Reaching further afield, OM intends to be a source and springboard to encourage campesino groups to take control of the destiny of their wild well-preserved forests by helping them maintain and expand virgin and unexploited forests, while facilitating the establishment of nurseries to seed, grow and produce flowers and plants for local and export markets. With special focus on the remarkable orchid, OM brings together like-minded people and those new to the natural wonders of Chiapas and their local forests to share in the majesty of orchids, as well as all other plant and animal life.;  ;  As it extends itself to the community, OM will continue to encourage the formation of orchid societies and satellite Jardines de Orquídeas in other areas of Chiapas and Mexico. OM now provides a space where new and existing information about orchids and epiphytes, plants living on the bark of trees and shrubs that are not parasites, can gather and grow; helping to create a natural and educational paradise nestled within the beauty of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico.;                        Main Address:;         Orquidario Moxquivil;         Periférico Norte #4a, Ojo de Agua;                San Cristóbal de Las Casas;        Chiapas 29228 Mexico;        ;                 Telephone: +52 (967) 678-5727;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.orchidsmexico.com;         Primary Email: info@orchidsmexico.com       ;
