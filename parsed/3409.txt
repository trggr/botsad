G. Kholodny Institute of Botany        Founded on September 8, 1921. ;  ;  Its primary research lines are:;  - taxonomic, floristic, phytocenotic, conservational and ecological studies of phytobiota and mycobiota; applied and theoretical issues of organization and dynamics of phyto- and cenodiversity; biodiversity monitoring and conservation. ;  ;  - studies of structural & functional organization of plants and fungi at the organism, cell and molecular levels in normal and altered (both natural and anthropogenic) environments. ;  ;  Principal achievements of the Institute: ;  ;  The Institute of Botany is an internationally known and leading Ukrainian institution doing research and assessment of phytological and mycological objects at various levels of living-matter organization – from molecules to ecosystems – and of their evolutionary pathways. The research focus is on the diversity of algae, bryophytes, vascular plants, fungi and lichens, development of phylogenetic systems; this information is presented in numerous fundamental “Floras” publications. Solving relevant taxonomy issues, Institute’s scientists described new families, genera and hundreds of new species. Theoretical principles of ecological and cenotic differentiation of plant communities, their functions under the impact of natural and anthrogenic factors, development of classification of various plant communities and publication of a prodromus of Ukraine’s vegetation are among their achievements. New approaches have been proposed for assessing the structure and functioning of ecological systems, which rely on thermodynamic laws, in particular, their energy parameters. Data concerning geographical aspects of biodiversity are presented in a series of maps and atlases. ;  ;  In experimental botany, developing ideas of academician M. G. Kholodny with methods of modern science, Institute's scholars obtained new data and made monographic theoretical generalizations on hormonal regulation of growth processes in various plant organs. In particular, they discovered the phenomenon of biparental inheritance of gene determinants of the cytoplasm in parasexual hybridization of somatic plant cells of both parental types; gravity response of plant cells not specialized to perceive gravitational vector; found general patterns in the effect of microgravitation on cells. Important recent results also involve the methods of higher production and extraction of lipids from microalgae and hydrogen production by these microorganisms, with a view to finding new sources of alternative energy. ;  ;  Applied studies resulted in scientific principles of ECONET development in Ukraine, scientific justification for establishing dozens of protected areas, monitoring data of their transformation under the impact of various factors, compilation of the Red and Green Data Books of Ukraine, obtaining highly productive strains of edible and medicinal mushrooms, new strains of microscopic algae, several practical technologies for mushroom cultivation, water treatment with algae, cultivation of Spirulina platensis microscopic alga and ‘Pensinorm’ and ‘Bactosol’ novel preparations for agriculture and livestock breeding.;  ;  The Institute of Botany consists of 10 research departments, the Interdepartmental Integrated Laboratory of Protected Areas, Experimental Station, Computer Centre, Scientific Library, and Editorial and Publishing Department. The Institute is the main institution in Ukraine and one of the leading institutions in Europe in studies of biodiversity at all levels of its organization related to vascular and cryptogamic plants and fungi.The basis for scientific investigations is formed by the unique collections accumulated by several generations of botanists, the herbarium of vascular, non-vascular plants and fungi, as well as the created in last decades the collection of living fungi and the algotheca. All collections include more than 1.6 million specimens. The Herbarium and the collection of fungal cultures are listed as the National Heritage objects.;                        Main Address:;         Botanic Garden of the М. G.
