Waugh Arboretum        The Waugh Arboretum at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is a landscape for learning. Our mission is to support research and educate the campus and regional communities about native and cultivated plants; improve the beauty and atmosphere of the campus setting; and engage in and promote the conservation and preservation of our natural ecosystems and resources.  To further our educational objectives, we seek to curate, develop, manage, and preserve specimens and collections of ornamental species which are indigenous, unique, or exotic and appropriate to the University landscape in support of our mission.;  ;  The Waugh Arboretum includes the entirety of the UMass Amherst campus (1400 acres +-).  The arboretum has two arboretum area types:;  1.)The core campus area where most campus structures and activities are located.  This core contains a diversity of specimen plantings that enhance the aesthetics of existing and future structures, and serves as a living laboratory exploring the uses of indigenous, unique, or exotic vegetation in a variety of landscapes.;  2.)The “outer campus” which includes conservation areas of young and mature forests, wetland, and successional communities.;                        Main Address:;         Frank A.
