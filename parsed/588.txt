It was founded in 1567, and for a long time it was the only one. It was originally thought as a garden for the teaching of medicinal herbs in the 16th century. Nowadays, the JBUV’s mission is to become a centre of excellence in research, conservation, education and understanding. Its aim is to contribute to a better management of the Earth’s environment by increasing knowledge, awareness and understanding of the Plant Kingdom, which is the basis of life on Earth, its importance and its conservation.;  ;  ;  The JBUV is one of the most valued heritage landmarks of the city of Valencia. Recently it has been declared a place of cultural and historical interest. In its research building (inaugurated in 2000) scientific, cultural and educational activities take place. We can also find the University of Valencia herbarium (with more than 200,000 specimens), a specialized library and a seed bank of Valencian and Mediterranean threatened flora.;  ;  All this near a beautiful garden of centenary trees with more than 4,500 cultivated species.;                        Main Address:;         Jardí Botànic de la Universitat de València;         Quart, 80;                Valencia;        46008 Spain;        ;                 Telephone: +(34) 963 15 68 00;         Fax: +34 6 315 68 26;         URL: www.jardibotanic.org;         Primary Email: botanic@uv.es       ;
