Its purpose was to provide frost-free growing conditions for plants unsuited to Canberra's climate. In 1995 the Gardens, along with the Jervis Bay National Park, were handed back to the local Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. The Park was renamed Booderee National Park in 1998, and the Gardens subsequently proclaimed as part of the Park in 2000. Whilst the Botanic Gardens now are independent and no longer exist as an annex, there are still close links with the ANBG. Booderee is jointly managed by the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council and the Director of National Parks under a 99 year lease agreement established in 1995.;  ;  The Botanic Gardens cover an area of 80 hectares including both natural vegetation and cultivated sections surrounding Lake McKenzie, a natural freshwater lake. A living collections policy guides the directions of the Gardens, determining the focus be on native flora from the south eastern NSW. A thematic collection of ethno-botanical plants supports the strong emphasis on Koori interpretation of traditional plant use. This service is utilised by schools in particular, but also by a wider audience in general. Other thematic plantings enable displays of ecological units such as rainforest, forest, heath and woodland, as well as horticultural displays. Taxonomic collections of Eucalyptus and Casuarinaceae are displayed on various lawns. Collaboration with national parks and other botanic gardens ensures the Gardens’ continued involvement in plant conservation in the local area.;  ;  The Gardens’ living collection is of high integrity and well documented due to continuous stock takes and other plant recordings, with data lodged on data bases shared with and supported by the ANBG.  All new plant accessions are complimented by herbarium specimens which are lodged at the Australian National Herbarium, Canberra, and copies kept at the Booderee Public Reference Herbarium.;  ;  The Gardens are open to the public 365 days of the year.;                        Main Address:;         Booderee Botanic Gardens;         Cave Beach Road;        Village Rd;        Jervis Bay;        JBT 2540 Australia;        ;                 Telephone: (02) 4429 7444;         Fax: 02 4442 1011;         URL: www.environment.gov.au/parks/booderee/explore/botanic/index.html;         Primary Email: Booderee.mail@environment.gov.au       ;
