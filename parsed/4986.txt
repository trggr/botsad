The centre currently houses over 3200 collections. All seed is sourced from the wild and fully documented.;  ;  The seed bank was established in 1992 and is located at the  Western Australian Herbarium. It has a drying room, walk-in cool room (4°C), freezer room (-20°C) and a laboratory equipped to conduct seed research. During its 17 years of operation, the Threatened Flora Seed Centre has made significant progress towards the ex situ seed storage of the State's rare and threatened flora.;  ;  The Threatened Flora Seed Centre is involved in national (eg.AuSCaR- Australian Seed Conservation and Research ) and international (eg. Millennium Seed Bank Project) seed conservation projects that contribute towards meeting Australia's obligations to the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation.;  TFSC lab;  Threatened Flora Seed Centre Lab;  ;  As DEC collects and stores seed for conservation purposes, seed from the Threatened Flora Seed Centre is not available to the public.;                        Main Address:;         Threatened Flora Seed Centre – Western Australia;         Western Australian Herbarium;        17 Dick Perry Avenue, Technology Park, Western Precinct;        Kensington;        Western Australia 6151 Australia;        ;                 Telephone: +61 (0)8 9334 0502;         Fax: +61 (0)8 9334 0515;         URL: www.dec.wa.gov.au;         Primary Email: tfsc@dpaw.wa.gov.au       ;
