Majestic tree-lined avenues and walks form the framework for hidden, more formal gardens such as the dahlia garden and a semi-circular herbaceous garden. Lord Fairhaven's impressive collection of statuary is positioned throughout the grounds and features in the garden layout. Many rare and unusual tree species on arboretum lawns and the parkland. More recently a large collection of snowdrops (Galanthus) has been established throughout the gardens along with an area on the eastern side dedicated to plants giving winter interest. The Winter Garden's serpentine path links into a mile-long circuit through the grounds.;  Main Address:; Anglesey Abbey; Quy Road; Lode; Cambridge; Cambridgeshire CB25 9EJ United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey; Primary Email: ;
