The total land area of the garden is 163.79 acre. At present, more than 10,500 individuals of about 900 plant species brought from 23 states of the country have been conserved in different sections/areas like Economic Plant, Green Belt/Woodland, Fruit, Medicinal Plant, Cactus & Succulents, Nurseries and Water bodies. The seeds of 269 plant species including Geodorum appendiculatum Griff. endemic to Assam and Andaman are conserved in Seed Bank. In water bodies of the garden, the Victoria amazonica (Poepp.) J.C.

Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongniart a Fern naturally grew in this garden. Not only this, the congenial condition may have been developed by the plantation/enrichment with the flora of the country, naturally, so many fauna are also attracted, harbouring and multiplying which need to be inventorised.;                        Main Address:;         BOTANIC GARDEN OF INDIAN REPUBLIC;         Botanical Survey of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change;        Govt. of India, Capt.
