In April and May, visitors enjoy drifts of daffodils and primroses, a wonderful variety of flowering trees and shrubs, and Fernwood’s famous blue lawn. Summer brings a rich diversity of shade- and sun-loving perennials, annuals, and herbs, plus many butterflies. Even after the first frosts of autumn, the gardens continue to delight with colorful displays of perennials and ornamental grasses.
