Special Collections:	Thanks to the Douglass estate, aerial photos were taken and topographical maps drawn up. Since then, students and Physical Plant workers have contributed to the continuing project of labeling and caring for the trees on campus. Some 3,000 woody trees and shrubs have been labeled, five of which were extinct on the North American continent from 2 to 50 million years ago.
