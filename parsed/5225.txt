The park is evaluated as one of four biodiversity centers of the country with forest ecosystems considered as standard models of sub-tropical moist rain evergreen forests and typical forests of low montane sub-tropical areas of Vietnam, as well. Its forests hold high values of natural landscapes, biodiversity with valuable and rare species and genetic resources.;  Since the establishment of 2004, from Vietnamese goverment budget, the activities of the park mainly concentrate on ex situ conservation of its important forest ecosystems, and endemic, patrimonial and national and international high valuable plant species. However, under negative impacts of population growth, infrastructure construction around and inside the core zone of the park as well as climate change, the danger of habitat fragmentation and the loss of these species are increasing. Therefore, beside the efforts of in situ conservation activities, since 2010, the park has built a plan to establish a botanic garden for the purpose of ex situ conservation these valuable species.  In 2014, from the support of experts of Australia Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust,  a master plan of a botanic garden of the park has been formulated and until now, initial infrastructure of the botanic garden has been constructed. The purposes of the parkâ€™s botanic garden are for ex situ conservation of endemic, patrimonial and national and international high valuable plant species, for scientific research, environmental education and scientific information exchange with other botanic gardens in the world.;                        Main Address:;         Bidoup Nuiba Botanic Garden;         Bidoup Nui Ba National Park;        5E Tran Hung Dao;        Dalat;        Lam Dong Province 670000 Viet Nam;        ;                 Telephone: +84633502061;         Fax: +84633813654;         URL: http://bidoupnuiba.gov.vn/;         Primary Email: icther.vqgbidoup@gmail.com       ;
