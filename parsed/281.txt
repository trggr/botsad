About 9’000 plant species are cultivated on the grounds. A special goal is to have a good representation of world wide plant diversity, European plants, and special collections, which are built up and maintained by research groups, such as water plants and primitive flowering plants. The new Botanic Garden was established in 1976. The small old Botanic Garden is still maintained as a public park in the centre of the town.;                        Main Address:;         Botanischer Garten der Universitaet Zurich;         Zollikerstrasse 107;                Zurich;        ZH 8008 Switzerland;        ;                 Telephone: +41 (0)44 634 84 11;         Fax: +41 (0)44 634 84 04;         URL: http://www.bg.uzh.ch/de.html;         Primary Email: botanischer.garten@systbot.uzh.ch       ;
