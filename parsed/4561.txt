Thousands of volunteer hours were donated to remove the acres of debris before construction could begin.The tropical greenhouse opened on November 8, 1997. Native butterflies were introduced in 1998 into the Butterfly House.;  ;  The WCBG is home to an Herb Garden, Cactus Garden, Rose Garden and Orchid Display that are maintained by local gardening organizations. The WCBG maintains several other gardens including the Childrens Secret Garden, Sh√Özan-en, Celebration Plaza, Community Garden and the lovely public gardens that surround our buildings. As the WCBG grows, more gardens will be developed.;                        Main Address:;         Western Colorado Botanical Gardens;         641 Struthers Avenue;                Grand Junction;        Colorado 81501 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (970) 245-3288;         Fax: (970) 245-9001;         URL: www.wcbotanic.org;         Primary Email: cdingman@wcbotanic.org       ;
