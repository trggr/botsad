Although the garden is for students' practical purposes, the overall idea of establishing a garden in the University is to make people aware of the importance of botanic gardens and to train them in the planning, planting and protection of such gardens; and to persuade landscape architects and Municipal Authorities to use native plants in their plantings whenever and wherever suitable.;                        Main Address:;         King Saud University Botanic Garden;         College of Science,;        Department of Botany and Microbiology,;        Riyadh;        Riyadh 11451 Saudi Arabia;        ;                 Telephone: +966-1-4675807;         Fax: +966-1-4675833;         URL: http://www.ksu.edu.sa/sites/Colleges/CollegeofScinces/BotanyDepartment/habg/Default.aspx;         Primary Email: jathomas@ksu.edu.sa       ;
