The garden was divided into a series of compartments and each "room" filled with an inspired and informal arrangement of plants around a theme: the White Garden, the Purple Border, the Rose Garden, the Herb Garden, the Lime Walk and the Cottage Garden. The White Garden shows Vita Sackville-West's sensitivity to colour and has inspired countless imitations. Rosa mulliganii erupts into a cascade of white flowers in summer, surrounded by numerous other plants with grey foliage and white blossoms. Other areas show the same ingenuity of planting. This combination of formal design and romantic planting has provided a major influence on garden design.;  Main Address:; Sissinghurst Castle Garden; Sissinghurst; Cranbrook; Kent TN17 2AB United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sissinghurst-castle/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sissinghurst-castle/; Primary Email: ;
