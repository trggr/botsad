Special Collections:	This collection has been developed since 1949, with a strong interest in ornamentals suitable for the coastal Pacific Northwest of the United States. The framework for the collection is a canopy of native Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga heterophylla and Thuja plicata. This is heavily underplanted with such natives as Blechnum spicant, Polystichum munitum, Vaccinium ovatum, V. ovalifolium and Mahonia nervosa. Among these is a rich collection on exotic species, with many representatives from Asia.
