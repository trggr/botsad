4-summers are mild, winter are harsh and often snowy. Forests of broad-leaved heliophilous give way to deciduous shade lovers (beech, chestnut, ecc.) and evergreen conifers: (spruce, silver fir)
4-• Hill belt. In this belt dry conditions decrease and rainfall is mainly concentrated in between seasons. The plants are mainly deciduous and fond of sun: deciduous oaks (Quercus pubescens, Quercus cerris), maples, hornbeams, meddlers, shrubs like hollies (Ilex aquifolium).
4-• Old greenhouse. Built in the late 1800’s in front of the round “banana” pond, it shelters exotics from the Amazon, Africa and Pacific islands. That is the belt of the Equator, hot and humid with abundant rainfall lasting 8-9 months and even more. Beneath the big trees of this rain forest a huge number of species with the strangest shape can be found, especially Orchidaceae or Bromeliaceae families, and many specie or ornamental plants (Anthurium, Pothos, Sanseveria, etc.). Many are epiphytes – they live on tree trunks and branches and so in the greenhouse they hang in baskets from the ceiling: the most important example are carnivorous plants like Nepenthes, which draws insects and spiders with a particular scent and “eat” them mainly for restoring nitrum resources – others are climbing, others grow on the rich humus continuously produced by the forest.
4-• Testing greenhouse. It shelters plants used for experiments of The Department: Nicotiana tabacum L., Solanum sppl., Cucurbita sppl., Inula sppl. It cannot be visited.
