Founded in 1831, it was the first large-scale designed landscape open to the public in the United States. Today its beauty, historical associations and horticultural collections are internationally renowned.;  ;  Our founders believed that burying and commemorating the dead was best done in a tranquil and beautiful natural setting at a short distance from the city center. They also believed that the Cemetery should be a place for the living, "embellishing" the natural landscape with ornamental plantings, monuments, fences, fountains and chapels. This inspired concept was copied widely throughout the United States, giving birth to the rural cemetery movement and the tradition of garden cemeteries. Their popularity led, in turn, to the establishment of America's public parks.;                        Main Address:;         Mount Auburn Cemetery;         580 Mount Auburn Street;                Cambridge;        Massachusetts 02138 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: 617-547-7105;         Fax: 617-547-7230;         URL: www.mountauburn.org;         Primary Email: info@mountauburn.org       ;
