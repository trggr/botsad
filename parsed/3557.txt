Of them, a 45-hectare area of particularly degraded land along the banks of the river Cormor was recently restored in an experimental park project. ;  At the entrance to this park the Pavilion destined to house small events, and the warden's house leaning up against it, give the key-note. ;  Designed by Pirzio-Biroli, the building is rich in references old and new. Its intention salutes the plan for the environs of Potsdam drawn up by Peter Joseph Lenné between 1816 and 1860.;  The project also imitates manner: that of Heinrich Tessenow in his first aketches for the National Gallery in Berlin, and of Lenné in his work on the 'Prussian Versailles'. ;  The figurative research at work in the design is based on the topography: a grove of slender poplars, and vistas receding into the countryside. ;  ;  from: l'architecture d'aujourd'hui;  Joze Plecnik -;                        Main Address:;         Giardino Botanico Friuli "Cormor";         Amici del Parco botanico;        via Sagrado 5;        Udine;        Friuli Venezia Giulia 33100 Italy;        ;                 Telephone: 3927156120;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.parcodelcormor.org;         Primary Email: parcobotanico@gmail.com       ;
