The long mixed borders are planted in an informal cottage style, offering colour and impact throughout the season. Orchards of traditional Ryedale apple varieties and old-fashioned culinary pears border the main lawn in front of the house. The grassland running through the orchards is managed as a wild-flower meadow with informal bulb planting to coincide with the apple and cherry blossom. Formal rose gardens along the south wall were originally planted by the donor family and there is a unique iris garden in a secluded corner of the garden.;                        Main Address:;         Nunnington Hall;         Nunnington;                York;        North Yorkshire YO62 5UY United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/nunnington-hall/;         Primary Email:        ;
