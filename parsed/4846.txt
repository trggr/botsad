Throughout the century the Temple family employed many leading architects, gardeners and sculptors of the day, including Vanbrugh, Bridgeman, Kent and Brown, to create an idealised classical landscape. Decorated with temples, columns and arches, different areas of the gardens such as the Elysian Fields and Grecian Valley, through their buildings, statuary and planting, evoke the classical world so admired by the Georgians. Initially formal, Stowe pioneered the movement towards more naturalistic landscape of grassy vistas and informal planting perpetuated by Capability Brown, head gardener at Stowe from 1741.;                        Main Address:;         Stowe Landscape Gardens;                         Buckingham;        Buckinghamshire MK18 5DQ United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stowe/;         Primary Email:        ;
