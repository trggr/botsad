The garden is in a valley on the banks of the Macal River, surrounded by the Maya Mountain foothills.; ; Modestly speaking we offer you beautiful plants in a beautiful place, but we're oh! so much more. Our main work is encouraging sustainable agriculture, maintaining conservation collections and engaging in conservation education. What that boils down to is that we aim to inspire our community and visitors (this could be you!) to protect our leafy friends and their habitats by learning more about the wonderful world of plants.
