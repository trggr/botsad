10-(LIFE11NAT/BE/001060), has implemented population translocations into the wild for four critically endangered plant species (<em>Dianthus deltoides, Helichrysum arenarium, Arnica montana and Campanula glomerata</em>). The aim is to increase the effective size of remaining populations (reinforcement) and to restore extinct populations (reintroduction) in order to improve connectivity in the landscape. Reintroductions were prepared using a four-step approach: 1) the selection and profiling of the target species
10-3) the development of propagation protocols and 4) the assessment of plant fitness of the populations used as seed source before planting out. <img style="display: block

Monitoring of reintroduced populations will continue for 10 years as only a long-term monitoring will tell what their future will be in the long run. <p style="text-align: justify

The living plant collections contribute to the botanical and horticultural research as well as to the education and conservation activities of the Garden. The greenhouse and outdoor collections together hold nearly 25000 accessions of living plants (about 17400 taxa and 3170 genera) which is about 6% of all known plant species of the world. Half of them can be seen in our greenhouses (Plant Palace), the other half, comprising cultivated and indigenous plants, grows outdoors.;  ;  The Outdoor Collections accommodate about 7800 taxa from all temperate regions of the world. A major part of them is planted in thematic collections open to the general public. Three systematic collections form the core of these plantings: the Herbetum (herbaceous plants arranged to the systems of Cronquist & Takhtajan), the Fruticetum (woody plants arranged to the system of Dahlgren) and the Coniferetum (gymnosperms arranged by genus). Nearly all hardy or 'half-hardy' genera are represented in these collections.;  ;  Another collection type is shown by the genera collections which give a thorough overview of the representatives of species and cultivars in the genera Quercus, Rhododendron, Hydrangea, Acer (Japanese & Chinese), Magnolia. Other developed thematic collections are the medicinal plants garden, the North American forest theme, the Mediterranean plants collection. A lot of collection plants are displayed in shrubberies and mixed borders all over the park. Rare or unusual tree species and cultivars are dispersed over the lawns and play the role of salt and pepper in the landscape dominated by indigenous tree plantations. Other important collections (e.g. Rosa and Paeonia) are occasionally open to the general public.;  ;  Well-represented plant families (on the whole outdoor collections) are Pinaceae (43% of extant species of the world), Sapindaceae (42%), Betulaceae (39%), Hydrangeaceae (37%), Caprifoliaceae (33%), Cornaceae (31%), Cupressaceae (20%), Berberidaceae (16%), Ranunculaceae (14%) and Rosaceae (13%).;  ;  Some trees (54) are really champion trees of Belgium and need special attention or care.;                        Main Address:;         Meise Botanic Garden;         Nieuwelaan 38;                Meise;        BelgiÃ« 1860 Belgium;        ;                 Telephone: 32 (0)2 260 09 20;         Fax: 32 (0)2 260 09 45;         URL: www.meisebotanicgarden.be;         Primary Email: info@plantentuinmeise.be       ;

9-C). As translocations involving these species at risk are particularly difficult, amongst others because of narrow ecological requirements, the scarcity of seed source populations, low seed quality and/or unknown propagation method, it was of utmost importance to understand the germination requirements of the 65 species conserved in the seed bank. A total of 174 germination trials were conducted under controlled environmental conditions. Considering all species together, germination and viability of fresh seeds reached on average 71 % and 82 %, respectively. Their storage behaviour (desiccation tolerance) was also determined through repeated tests after 6, 12 and 24 months in seed bank conditions. <p style="text-align: center

These metalliferous sites are represented by hills isolated in the woodland, where the total copper concentration in the soil is 200 times higher than in standard soils. These extreme conditions have led to the formation of a unique type of vegetation: &ldquo
