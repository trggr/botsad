-s most remarkable and rare plants. This is the case in Upper-Katanga, including some of the largest ore bodies of copper and cobalt in the world. These metalliferous sites are represented by hills isolated in the woodland, where the total copper concentration in the soil is 200 times higher than in standard soils. These extreme conditions have led to the formation of a unique type of vegetation:	&ldquo

-(LIFE11NAT/BE/001060), has implemented population translocations into the wild for four critically endangered plant species (<em>Dianthus deltoides, Helichrysum arenarium, Arnica montana and Campanula glomerata</em>). The aim is to increase the effective size of remaining populations (reinforcement) and to restore extinct populations (reintroduction) in order to improve connectivity in the landscape. Reintroductions were prepared using a four-step approach:	1) the selection and profiling of the target species

-The first results have been very positive:	over 90% of reintroduced individuals survived the transplantation stress, and the flowering rate (&gt

The Outdoor Collections accommodate about 7800 taxa from all temperate regions of the world. A major part of them is planted in thematic collections open to the general public. Three systematic collections form the core of these plantings:	the Herbetum (herbaceous plants arranged to the systems of Cronquist & Takhtajan), the Fruticetum (woody plants arranged to the system of Dahlgren) and the Coniferetum (gymnosperms arranged by genus). Nearly all hardy or 'half-hardy' genera are represented in these collections.
