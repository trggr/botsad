Komarov Botanical Institute        St. Petersburg Botanical Garden is one of the oldest in our country. The Garden served as the basis for an "Apothecary garden", founded by Peter I in 1714 for the cultivation of medicinal herbs, as well as rare and interesting foreign plants. The growth of the collections and the importance of the botanical studies led to the establishment in 1823 of the Imperial Botanical Garden. During the years 1823-1824 is built quads greenhouses, which largely survive to this day. At the same time, the grounds were created. By 1913, the Garden became the national center of plant science and one of the leading botanical institutions in the world.;  ;  Two articles written on the collections of the Komarov Botanical Institute's Botanical Garden:;  ;  Tkachenko K.
