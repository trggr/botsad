The;  layout of the gardens, as depicted in the map, includes various;  areas. Associated with the gardens is a natural reserve comprising the Biasoletto wood and the Farneto wood (for a;  total of 90 ha).;  The Botanical Gardens publishes the Index Seminum,;  where each year the species for which seeds are offered are;  listed, complete with all of the collection data. The list is sent;  to most of the other botanical gardens throughout the world;  as part of a free exchange between scientific institutes.;  Already a linchpin in the relationship between scientific;  research and environmental conservation, botanical gardens;  have also become a centre for teaching and;  recreation. The aim of the gardens is to satisfy;  the needs of both advanced scientific;  research and a new environmental;  awareness, so as to develop activities of a cultural;  nature for an increasingly broader section of the public.;  As well as the research and systematic classification performed,;  botanical gardens have taken on the role of the conservation,;  cultivation and reproduction of officinal plants,;  plants for textile production and foodstuffs, local horticultural;  varieties, spontaneous and endemic flora of the region and;  surrounding areas, aquatic and palustrine plants, succulent;  plants. For this reason botanical gardens may be seen as an;  island, albeit artificial, of floristic diversity which plays a;  strategic part in the conservation of biodiversity, and therefore;  in the survival of mankind itself.;  When the gardens are integrated into the daily life of the citizens,;  as is the case in Trieste, they are no longer a facility for;  the exclusive use of botanists, but rather open to a much;  broader public intent on enriching its own culture, or perhaps;  escaping from a polluted and alienating;  urban environment.;                        Main Address:;         Civico Orto Botanico;         via dei Tominz 4 (Office);        via Carlo de' Marchesetti 2;        Trieste;        Friuli Venezia Giulia 34139 Italy;        ;                 Telephone: +39 040 360 068 -348 639 3055;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.ortobotanicotrieste.it/;         Primary Email: ortobotanico@comune.trieste.it       ;
