It was established by the renowned Iris Bannochie as a private family garden. Previously farmland, Mrs Bannochie created a unique garden with many trees, palms and other plants collected from her travels across the globe.  Andromeda was first opened to the public during a fund-raising event hosted by the Barbados Horticultural Society in 1976 and has remained open to the public by paid admission since then. Currently undergoing a plant identification process, the current management team estimates that Andromeda has approximately 500 different species of plants;                        Main Address:;         Andromeda Botanic Gardens;         Bathsheba;                St Joseph;        Barbados;        ;                 Telephone: 1 246 433 9384;         Fax: ;         URL: www.andromedabarbados.com;         Primary Email: info@andromedabarbados.com       ;
