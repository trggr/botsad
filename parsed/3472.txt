Info:	  United States of America - Utah - Kaysville  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Utah State University Botanical Center The Utah Botanical Center is where Utah’s future grows as we address critical issues confronting people in our state and throughout the Intermountain West; increased urbanization and limited water supplies, diminishing public open space, and a shrinking resource base for native plants, wildlife, and wetlands. Through workshops, Utah State University courses and research, demonstration areas, community events and improving an important urban fishery, the UBC provides information and inspiration that can guide us to a more sustainable future.; ; The UBC demonstrates and practices sustainable principles which can significantly reduce impacts on the land and other valuable resources. Demonstrations use environmentally friendly products, recycled materials, and water-conserving landscapes. Sustainable home landscaping, wetland restoration, habitat creation, and water quality enhancement are all highlighted on public open space.; ; And while education and innovation are among our primary goals, we know that recreation and connecting with the outdoors can be an oasis for the soul in the midst of an increasingly busy world. ; ; The UBC is the result of a shared vision and partnerships between Utah State University, public agencies, individuals, civic groups, businesses, and foundations–important alliances that are bringing the UBC to fruition.;  Main Address:; Utah State University Botanical Center; 920 South 50 West; P.O.
