Photographic evidence, brick-shards, Yuccas, Cedars and the c.1847 Osage Orange tree are all remnants of the new, approx. 1 acre kitchen / ornamental garden created during the alterations made to the property by John McGavock. The simple layout is a variation of one of A. J. Downing’s designs for American gardens.;   ;  The cultivation of the garden must have been especially important to John and Carrie. This is evident in his will that states, “I will and bequeath to my wife Carrie W. the exclusive possession and control of my residence, yard, and garden.”;   ;  Under the guidance and direction of Gerry Doell, recognized as one of the leading scholar/historians of mid-19th century American gardening, the McGavock’s garden was reconstructed in the mid-1990s using plant material available in Middle Tennessee prior to 1869.;                        Main Address:;         Historic Garden at Carnton Plantation;         1345 Eastern Flank Circle;                Franklin;        TN 37064 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (615) 794-0903;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.battleoffranklintrust.org/carnton_gardens.htm;         Primary Email: justinstelter@gmail.com       ;
