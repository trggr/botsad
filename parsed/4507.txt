All life depends on plants. Clean air, clean water, food, shelter, clothing, and, traditionally, medicine—all of these resources, too often taken for granted, rely on plants. These fundamental facts motivate the Garden’s mission and its many activities that respond to issues that affect people close to home and around the world.;  ;  The Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank, a conservation project at the Chicago Botanic Garden, aims to collect and store, or bank, the seeds of tallgrass prairie region flora. The goal of the seed banking project is global in scope. The Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank, in association with the national Seeds of Success (SOS) program, is part of an international seed conservation initiative collectively known as the Millennium Seed Bank Project (MSBP), originally developed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in the United Kingdom. This global program aims to bank 10 percent of the world’s flora by 2010 for long-term storage and conservation.;                        Main Address:;         Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank at Chicago Botanic Garden;         1000 Lake Cook Road;                Glencoe;        Illinois 60022 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (847) 835-5440;         Fax: (847) 835-4484;         URL: https://sciencecollections.org/content/dixon-national-tallgrass-prairie-seed-bank;         Primary Email: PVitt@chicagobotanic.org       ;
