In developing the site we believed in two principles: permaculture and that it has to help societal transformation. In permaculture we kept the garden unchanged for two years to study at least two seasons of plants to make sure we do not do anything to disturb the many interesting and rare local species (e.g. orchids, star of Bethlehem).  The botanic garden provides the opportunity for in-situ and ex-situ conservation of endangered and rare plants, as well as a very lively education on plant biology, taxonomy, protection and importance and various research topics. A preliminary botanical survey showed we have >388 species of plants on site. A briefing on PIBS is found in this short video https://youtu.be/BPhFLOsEIM0 and a tour of the Garden can be found here: https://youtu.be/7cBil5ahC6o.
