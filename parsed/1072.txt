The Gardens have seen a remarkable growth since then. The site has been transformed into a luxuriant landscape that serves as an area for research into environmentally sustainable approaches to land management, as well as a location for environmental education. More than 250 tree species have been planted in the 25-acre arboretum, 5,500 specimens have been planted in the 10-acre conservation forest, and a TDEF plant nursery has been created, capable of producing 50,000 seedlings per year to promote the re-introduction of the indigenous flora of the region.;  ;  Conservation and preservation of the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest (TDEF) is the Botanical Garden’s special mission. Since Auroville’s inception, teams of green workers involved in the reforestation work of Auroville have been making trips to sacred groves to collect seeds of the native TDEF species. Despite this, a recent survey done by the Botanical Garden has shown that sacred groves are still rapidly shrinking in size. Encroachment is rampant. Fortunately, with Auroville now having all the native TDEF species, seed collection happens within Auroville itself.;                        Main Address:;         Auroville Botanical Gardens;         Edayanchavadi Airport Road;                Auroville;        Tamil Nadu 605 101 India;        ;                 Telephone: +914132623498;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.auroville-botanical-gardens.org;         Primary Email: botanical@auroville.org.in       ;
