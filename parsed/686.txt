Imagine it dotted with gardens, spreading lawns, towering trees and divided by a rushing creek.  Imagine silence, punctuated by the calls of birds, the laughter of children and the ringing of bells.  This is Friendship Gardens, a sheltered treasure nestled on the eastern edge of Michigan City, Indiana.;  ;  These are historic gardens, inspired by the 1936 Century of Progress in Chicago and created on land traced with trails used for centuries by Native Americans.  The gardens are open to welcome you the second weekend of May through the last weekend of October.  They are open daily 10 AM â€“ 4 PM, except Mondays.  Admission is $4 with a limit of $10 per family and children under 12, free.   They are accessed by walking earthen trails and lawns.  A golf cart is available to transport those with mobility limitations.;  ;  The gardens are available for rental for weddings and other  events.  A variety of concerts and other cultural activities are scheduled.   The gardens are owned and managed by a not for profit board. Volunteers and donors are the lifeblood of this public garden, which depends on contributions of time and resources for their continued growth.;                        Main Address:;         International Friendship Gardens;         P.O.
