It is home to an outstanding collection of plants from Australia and overseas. Wrapped around Farm Cove at the edge of Sydney Harbour, the Royal Botanic Gardens occupy one of Sydney's most spectacular positions. ;  ;  This garden is a BGCI Patron Member.;                        Main Address:;         Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney;         Mrs Macquaries Road;                Sydney;        New South Wales 2000 Australia;        ;                 Telephone: 61-(0)2-9231-8111;         Fax: ;         URL: www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au;         Primary Email:        ;

8-The Community Greening Project is externally funded by <a href="http: //www.housing.nsw.gov.au"><strong>HNSW, the Department of Family and community Services</strong></a>.
8-To meet this objective the Community and Education Programs unit has forged strong links with communities who have established or are interested in establishing their own communal gardens. <p style="text-align: justify
8-Working in partnership with <a href="http: //www.housing.nsw.gov.au/" target="_blank">Housing New South Wales </a>(HNSW), local authorities and businesses, the project enables the RBGDT to reach new audiences and provide practical environmental education at no cost to participants. RBGDT provides advice, technical expertise, education, training, guidance and surplus plant and landscaping material.

9-Renew will capture genetic profiles using leaf collections from 30-50 populations of over 200 plant species commonly used in bush regeneration. The genetic profiles (obtained via high throughput genomic analyses), distribution and environmental requirements of each species are analysed, collated and mapped along with current and future climate models to inform recommendations for ideal plantings and seed sourcing. This information will remove much of the generalisation and guesswork from revegetation work, helping to create new populations that are self-sustaining and resilient. <p style="text-align: justify

9-The project has the potential to save time and money by increasing the chances that a newly planted area is genetically suitable and likely to flourish over time. <img style="display: block
