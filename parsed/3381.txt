As a botanical garden, it preserves and nurtures forty-six acres of Chester County's rapidly disappearing natural environments. The Arboretum is one of Pennsylvania's major horticultural showcases of native trees, shrubs, rhododendrons, azaleas, laurels, blueberries, ferns and wildflowers. Included in the collection are rhododendron varieties from all over the world. The Arboretum's preservation of natural habitats and watershed presents a model for others to follow. With its living collections of flowering plants and trees, the Arboretum serves as an educational tool for children and adults for the stewardship of this woodland ecosystem. The Arboretum provides a habitat for many varieties of wildlife, such as green herons, foxes, king fishers, red-tail hawks, owls, flying squirrels, turtles, and 108 identified bird species.
