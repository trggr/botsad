A community park with 2 play structures, basketball, tennis courts, and a large lawn, Heritage Park is a favorite among residents.  ;  ;  The Botanical Gardens were added in phases starting in 2000 after Mayor Pro Tem, C. Shane Wilbanks visited Botanica in Wichita, Kansas.  After Mrs. Bessie Mitchell passed away, the City of Grapevine purchased an additional 2.5 acres just south of the park.  The Garden has been evolving since.;                        Main Address:;         Grapevine Botanical Gardens at Heritage Park;         411 Ball Street;        Mailing: P.O.
