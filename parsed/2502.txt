The arboretum is situated at 12 km south-east from the Toliara town, 2 km north from the Tropic of Capricorn and 3 km from the Mozambique Channel waters. Antsokay is a very close small hamlet where limestone can be extracted to make quick lime. ;   ;  On a surface of 40 hectares, surrounded by vegetal hedges, the project initiator exerted himself to have the most threatened plants species, reproduced and multiplied either by seeding,cutting or transplantation process in order to preserve most of them from constant deforestation, bush fire and looters. ;   ;  The Antsokay Arboretum is entirely devoted to conservation of the plants from the southwestern part of Madagascar and is working in close collaboration with many institutions aiming in environment preservation, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, WWF, CEPF…Presently, after more than 25 years of passion, protection and care, the Arboretum offers to the visitors a real condensed vegetation, presenting a typical spiny thicket at a sub-arid stage. Opened to the public, 4 hectares of the Arboretum have been arranged to a real botanical garden comprising a collection of plants from southwest of Madagascar. More than 900 species are being preserved there, of which 90% are endemic to the region and 80% have medicinal virtues. Among them, many succulent species are being recognized to be threatened.;                        Main Address:;         Arboretum d‘Antsokay;         B.P. 489 Toliara 601;                Toliara;        Madagascar;        ;                 Telephone: 00261 (0) 34 07 600 15;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.antsokayarboretum.org;         Primary Email:        ;
