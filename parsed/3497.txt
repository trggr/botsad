It is a seven acre collage of several distinct gardens, with winding pathways, cascading pools, and distinctive bridges which lead you across the pond to an island oasis.  It typifies the southern garden with features worth emulating in our own backyards.;                        Main Address:;         Mynelle Gardens;         City of Jackson;        4736 Clinton Boulevard;        Jackson;        Mississippi 39209 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (601) 960-1894;         Fax: ;         URL: www.jacksonms.gov/visitors/mynellgardens;         Primary Email:        ;
