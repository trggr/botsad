KBCC’s mission is to conserve tropical and sub-tropical plants and maintain rich biodiversity on earth. In order to fulfill this mission, our present goal is to collect 40,000 different taxa and become the largest shelter of tropical plants on earth by 2027. The ultimate aim is to reintroduce plants back to the wild environment. The abundant plants, currently housed in 17 greenhouses, are under professional management.;  ;  The center has facilities for both tissue culture and cryo-preservation and currently runs a 'Deep Frozen' cryopreservation project with a target of 240,000 specimens from the collections at KBCC.;  ;  KBCC also has partnerships with international organizations such as Fairy Lake Botanic Garden and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conserve the plants of Southern China as well as The Solomon Islands to survey, collect vouchers and living specimens of native flora (http://siflora.nmns.edu.tw). ;  ;  In addition to practical plant conservation, KBCC also plays an important role in research and education. Scientists are invited to use the resources from KBCC for research and students join the center for internships as well as through the Future Earth Ecology Project to educate the young future scientists of Taiwan.;                        Main Address:;         Dr Cecilia Koo Botanic Conservation Center;         No 31, Tongsing Rd;        Gaoshu Township;                Pingtung County 90646 Taiwan, China;        ;                 Telephone: 886.8.796.0913;         Fax: 886.8.796.0913;         URL: http://www.kbcc.org.tw/tw/;         Primary Email:        ;
