The land has been farmed and grazed since the mid-19th century, when Abraham Lincoln traveled on the same road during his New Salem days.; ; Old trees in the forested areas date to about 1850, and the oldest planted trees were started from seed in 1964 and transplanted from another location. Permanent records kept by Starhill Forest include provenance information, propagation method and year, mapped location within the arboretum via a surveyed grid system, and other data. In addition, permanent records of other taxa that have been tested and have not survived include cause of death, when known. ; ; The primary scientific collection is a quercetum (oak) comprising the living reference collection recognizedby the North American Plant Preservation Council. Additionally, approximately 150 other genera of woody plants are available for study, as well as herb and perennial landscapes, a native prairie garden, several provenance tests, and a conifer plantation.;  Main Address:; Starhill Forest Arboretum; 12000 Boy Scout Trail; Petersburg; Illinois 62675 United States of America; ;  Telephone: ; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starhillforest.com">www.starhillforest.com; Primary Email: Guy@Starhillforest.com ;
