Info:	  Kenya - Nairobi  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: NAIRA; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: Yes; About the Friends of Nairobi Arboretum Nairobi Arboretum:-the place of trees ...for nature, ...for people; Nairobi Arboretum occupies a 30.4 hectare site situated about 3 km from the Kenya's Capital centre - Nairobi City, adjacent to State House and bounded by the Kirichwa Kubwa River on the North-west side. It was originally established in 1907 by Mr. Battiscombe, Deputy Chief Conservator of Forests, mainly as a trial plot for fast growing exotic tree species, to meet the high demand of fuel wood for the newly contructed Kenya-Uganda railway line and thus save Kenya's indigenous forests. It was subsequently gazetted as a Forest Reserve in 1932.; ; Under the stewardship of a succession of Foresters whose policy was to obtain seeds from all over the globe to make as complete a collection of indigenous and exotic trees and shrubs as possible, the initial trial plot gradually developed into an arboretum - "a living collection of trees".; ; Friends of Nairobi Arboretum (FONA) was founded in 1993, under the umbrella of Nature Kenya (East Africa Natural History Society), since then FONA has been working alongside Kenya Forest Service (formerly Forest Department) to maintain this green gem for recreation, education and scientific knowledge. An environmental education and outreach programme runs throughout the year that involves hosting academic institutions, corporate and general public visiting the arboretum.; ; Over the years, the Arboretum has become a vital green pocket in the midst of an ever expanding concrete city jungle. It reflects our rich natural and cultural heritage through the more than 350 tree species (indigenous and exotic), more than a hundred resident and migrant ; bird species, a multitude of insects, reptiles and small mammals, notably the playful Vervet(Black-faced) and Sykes monkeys. For the innumerable local and international visitors â€“ including increasing numbers of school groups from all over Kenya, this is a place where lungs ; can be filled with fresh and clean air whilst you enjoy the tranquility of nature and the lovely bird sounds or the hard to detect Cicadas; while strolling, jogging, praying and/or travelling from continent to continent through an abundance of trees and other plants. ; ; The Arboretum also provides an extremely popular venue for a variety of events such as weddings, concerts, team building, corporate parties, and launches among others.;  Main Address:; Friends of Nairobi Arboretum; P.O.
