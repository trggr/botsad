Its founders, the Ahrens family, designed and planted a seven acre mountain top area starting in 1977, to display the range of native and exotic trees and shrubs that successfully adapt to the rigorous climate at 2,400 feet elevation.  Over time the Arboretum has grown to 178 acres, an area which includes ecologically important and visually stunning meadows, wetlands and forests. As the Arboretum has grown in size, its commitment to land stewardship has grown as well, both in managing the important watershed ecosystem and in curating collections focused on native plant communities and their relationships to environmental health. In addition, the Arboretum conducts public programming, lectures and workshops which promote environmental stewardship and appreciation for the beauty and importance of the Catskill Mountains.;                        Main Address:;         Mountain Top Arboretum;         4 Maude Adams Road;        P.O.
