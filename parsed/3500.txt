Its owner, Virginia Robinson (of Robinsons-May department store fame), was known as "The First Lady of Beverly Hills." She transformed her hilly, six-acre estate into a lushly landscaped, tropical oasis. Her regular bridge games at the estate attracted actors Fred Astaire, Charles Boyer and Maurice Chevalier. She was also known for her grand parties, which were attended by dignitary such as Ronald Reagan. When she died in 1977 (at age 99) she was busy planning her 100th birthday party! She willed her manor to the County for the public's enjoyment.
