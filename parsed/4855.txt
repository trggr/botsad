Excellent displays of daffodils and narcissus from March to May can be seen throughout the gardens. The Pleasure Grounds contain an informal collection of ornamental trees and shrubs from North America, Europe and the Far East and a National Collection of walnut trees (Juglans sp.).  Serpentine paths lead to the restored walled garden which contains the rebuilt 1790s glasshouses by Sir John Soane. There is a full hectare of walled vegetable garden, the produce of which is used in the restaurant.;                        Main Address:;         Wimpole Hall;         Arrington;                Royston;        Cambridgeshire SG8 0BW United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wimpole-estate/;         Primary Email:        ;
