-">Denver Botanic Gardens is committed to plant research and conservation and has active programs related to <em>ex situ</em> and <em>in situ</em> conservation and monitoring of rare plants, biodiversity surveys of regional flora, restoration, phenology, conservation genetics, phylogenetics, and taxonomy. One of the gardens sites, Chatfield Farms, is a 700 acre property 15 miles south of the Denver metro area (and the gardens urban campus) which has been intensively managed since the mid-1800s. Today, Chatfield is a mosaic of plant communities that can be divided into three broad categories:	agricultural pasture, grasslands, and riparian plant communities. The mission of Chatfield Farms is to inspire the public to be good stewards of the environment by connecting people to our past, present and future relationships with native plants of the Rocky Mountain Region. One of the initiatives laid out in the master plan for Chatfield Farms is to offer publicly accessible examples of prairie and riparian restoration. While we have long-term plans to restore prairie habitat, we are currently working to restore 5.5 acres of degraded riparian habitat along Deer Creek, which not only serves as a heavily used wildlife corridor but is also the area most used by visitors.
