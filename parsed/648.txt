9-">Beavers have helped improve riparian habitat at Chatfield Farms by reducing the impacts of previous creek channelization. <p style="text-align: center
9-">So far over 1150 native willows and cottonwoods have been planted in a 2.2 ha area and weed removal is ongoing. Other elements of the restoration plan include a hands on restoration opportunity for metro area youth, protecting desirable trees from beaver (tree painting), removing Siberian elms, Russian olives and other noxious weeds, long-term vegetation monitoring, and public education through botanical illustration, a demonstration garden and an interpretive trail. A key objective of this project is to use the riparian demonstration garden and interpretive trail to educate the c.150 000 visitors that come to Chatfield Farms annually, mostly from nearby urban areas, about the need for restoration work to protect waterways. <p style="text-align: justify
9-">This reach of creek has been impacted by past agricultural practices and by recent urbanization of the watershed. During the early twentieth century the creek was channelized to provide more efficient use of the land for farming. Spoil piles from excavating the new channel were discarded in the floodplain. Toward the end of the twentieth century and into this century, residential and commercial development in the watershed has modified the hydrology with increased volume and intensity of runoff to the creek. This channelization forces most of the increased runoff to stay in the channel generating bed scour which creates an even deeper channel. Denver Botanic Garden Chatfield Farms restoration project includes the installation of small channel structures that function like beaver dams to facilitate overbank flows to move water from the stream channel and distribute it across the floodplain, which will restore the hydrologic conditions suitable for the regeneration of cottonwoods and willows. This will, in turn, encourage more beaver activity in the reach over the long-term by increasing food availability. The end result is a more diverse flood plain habitat and habitat for fish and macroinvertebrates. The aquatic habitat is currently degraded due to high flow energies in the creek. Restoration efforts will reduce flow energies in the creek and greatly reduce the potential for erosion in the channel. This will provide the opportunity to create floodplain habitat without excavation to recreate oxbow areas. The oxbow wetlands would be connected to the creek to provide additional refugia habitat. The newly created riparian areas will be planted with a variety of native vegetation, mostly locally-sourced willows and cottonwoods. <p style="text-align: justify
