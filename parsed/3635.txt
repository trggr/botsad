For this reason, it is ideal for annual crop production, and nearly all the area is cultivated. Field surveys conducted by the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority have indicated that less than 0.1% of the 1.1 million acre Regina Plain Landscape Area remains as native prairie.;  ;  Because differences in topography, soils, and geographic location may lead to differences in species composition and genetic characteristics, restoring native prairie on the Regina Plain using seed from plants found within the landscape should conserve species and genetic diversity.;  ;   ;  The nursery allows the multiplication of the small amount of wild seed that is available. It is also increases the ease of harvesting and protects remnant sites from being harmed by repeated removal of seeds. By putting the nursery in the city, it will not only conserve species and genetic biodiversity, but provide opportunities for research, education, and urban awareness.;  ;  The nursery presently contains 56 species of forbs, 25 species of grass, 3 sedges, and 4 woody species for a total of 89 species.;                        Main Address:;         Regina Plain Native Plant Nursery;         Riverside Memorial Park;        815 Assiniboine Avenue E.;        Regina;        Saskatchewan S4P 3C8 Canada;        ;                 Telephone: (306) 787-8707;         Fax: (306) 787-0780;         URL: www.swa.ca/Stewardship/PrairieStewardship/Default.asp?type=Nursery  or  http://www.cwf-fcf.org/en/what-we-do/habitat/gardening-gab/feature-nurseries/regina-plain-native-prairie-seed-nursery.html;         Primary Email: jennifer.lohmeyer@swa.ca       ;
