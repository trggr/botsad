The Amorys together designed, planted and maintained growing collections of magnolia, rhododendron, unusual trees and shrubs, bulbs and herbaceous plants within their "Garden in the Wood". This is laid out beyond the formal lawns surrounded by battlemented yews, a topiary chase scene and a circular lily pool. Knightshayes is a collection of gardens linked together by design using plant texture and colour to provide interest from early springtime to the autumn.;  ;  The walled garden is part of the original Victorian layout and was restored in 2011. It is soil association approved and is managed using stock free and low tillage methods. The varieties grown are generally classic or modern but we do care for a collection of about 150 varieties of tomatoes in seed and grow about 30-50 different varieties a year.;                        Main Address:;         Knightshayes;         Bolham;                Tiverton;        Devon EX16 7RQ United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 01884 254665;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/knightshayes-court/;         Primary Email: knightshayes@nationaltrust.org.uk       ;
