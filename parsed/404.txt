While the "Flora" displays different garden styles over the ages (french baroque, italian renaissance, english garden), the Botanic Garden offers you the chance of a journey around the world's plant life within several hours. Being the most beautiful garden of Cologne and an outstanding one in Germany, Flora and Botanic Garden of Cologne serve as an important center for nature experience, botanical education, science and recreation for more than 750.000 visitors per year.;  The "Flora" was founded in 1863 as a private company; it was planned by Peter Josef Lenné and had a winter garden with a glass roof and restaurant, modelled after the London Crystal Palace. Opened in 1864, the "Flora" became a famous attraction for weekend trips and dance balls.;  A scientific botanic garden was founded in 1890 in the south of Cologne city, but as well had to give way to traffic needs. In 1914 a new area, north of the "Flora", could be opened as the new Botanic Garden. In 1920 the "Flora" was transferred to the authority of the township and was united with the Botanic Garden.;  The Botanic Garden has more than 12.000 plant species from all climates and vegetation types in cultivation.
