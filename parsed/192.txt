For example it exists a dry meadow of national importance with rare native plants. Visitors can walk in a rare forest of old oaks and lime-trees.;  Since 2014, a new garden of evolution tells the story of the coevolution and symbiosis between flora and other organismus with the help of living plants and fossils.;  With a wide range of conferences, events and visits, we carry out each year new temporary exhibitions (2012: Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the botany; 2013: flowers of bees;  2019: "tropical rainforests" and "Plants drawings of M.
