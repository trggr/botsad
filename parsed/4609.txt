The main trail has been named the Dent Smith Trail in honor of the founder of the Palm Society, a worldwide organization primarily engaged in the study of the palm family, in all its aspects. Florida Tech's Garden, through the intense interest of Founding President Emeritus Jerome P. Keuper and the inspiration and help of Mr. Dent Smith in the 1960's, has become one of the most unique campus botanical gardens of its kind in the continental United States.;  Main Address:; Florida Tech Botanical Garden; 150 W.
