The south-east slopes and terraces offer conditions suitable for tender sun-loving plants including palms and a 100-year-old lemon tree. Collections also include rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias, herbaceous, dahlias and mixed borders. Winding paths give views over attractive parkland. The Mill Walk at the base of the tor was mostly planted by Mrs Alys Luttrell in the early 1920s and restored by the National Trust after receiving the property from Colonel Luttrell in 1976.
