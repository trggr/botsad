Already at its present location in Vienna's third district, this formed the basis for today's Botanical Garden attached to the Institute of Botany at the Faculty of Natural Sciences. ;  After several changes, the Botanical Garden now presents a synthesis between a 19th century landscape garden and a display of plants in systematic and plant-geographical arrangement. Several smaller areas in the garden are devoted to specific topics, such as useful plants, succulents, alpine floras, vegetation types of Austria, plant genetics and evolution etc.;  Today, the Garden covers an area of ca. 8 ha.;  It is open to the public all year long free of charge.;  The greenhouses (ca. 1.500 m2), originally built between 1890 - 1893, were severely damaged during World Wars I and II, and are now renovated or rebuilt. Because of space problems, most of the greenhouses are used for scientific purposes only and not open to the public. However, a permanent "rainforest-exhibition" for visitors has been established in one greenhouse.;                        Main Address:;         Core Facility Botanical Garden;         University of Vienna;        Rennweg 14;        Vienna;        1030 Austria;        ;                 Telephone: 43 (0)1 4277 54100;         Fax: 43 (0)1 4277 9541;         URL: https://botanischergarten.univie.ac.at/;         Primary Email: botanik@univie.ac.at       ;
