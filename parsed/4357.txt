PSML is a company of exclusively public equity, established in 2000 following recognition by UNESCO of Sintra's Cultural Landscape as a World Heritage site and is responsible for the restoration, maintenance and management of these properties.;   ;  ;  The gardens of Monserrate were built in 1790 by Gerard De Visme, an English merchant who had made his fortune in trade with Brazil. A correspondent of Sir Joseph Banks he co-funded plant hunting expeditions to Brazil and other exotic locations to provide plants for his gardens. Monserrate was briefly the home of William Beckford and Byron visited and described the house and garden exactly 200 years ago (Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage). The botanical gardens were founded in the 1850’s by Sir Francis Cook, Bt., and developed over four generations (1856-1947). Plant collections include a number of magnificent tree specimens, some of which are probably among the largest of their kind in cultivation: Araucaria heterophylla, Araucaria bidwillii, Metrosideros excelsa, Apollonias barbujana, Agathis robusta. The garden contains fine palms and tree ferns and some cycads including an enormous Lepidozamia peroffskyana. Garden restoration work is currently underway; in 2009 the succulent plant collections known historically as “Mexico” were reconstructed, in the coming year it is planned to reinstate the ornamental ponds, rose garden and tree fern valley.;   ;  The park of Pena is a vast area (85 ha.) spread over the highest points of the Serra de Sintra. Originally a convent (founded in 1503), it was transformed by King Ferdinand II, consort of the Queen Maria II and a cousin of  Queen Victoria’s consort Prince Albert. From 1840 onwards he began to build the fantastic revivalist castle and the surrounding forests and gardens. The gardened areas contain important collections of Camellias, Tree Ferns, Conifers and areas of natural vegetation whilst the arboretum contains impressive individual specimens of Cryptomeria japonica, Sequoia sempervirens, Thuya plicata and various species of Abies. From 1910 the park was administered by the Portuguese national forest service and there are extensive trial plantings of forest species. Currently undergoing extensive restoration work is a section of the park known as the “Chalet da Condessa.” Here the gardens are of a gardenesque character and contain a tremendous population of tree ferns, camellias, azaleas and rhododendrons.;                        Main Address:;         Parques de Sintra - Monte da Lua S.A.;         Parque de Monserrate;                Sintra;        2710-405 Portugal;        ;                 Telephone: (+351) 21 910 5340;         Fax: (+351) 21 910 5341;         URL: http://www.parquesdesintra.pt;         Primary Email: info@parquesdesintra.pt       ;
