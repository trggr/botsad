Info:	  United Kingdom - Gwynedd, Wales - Bangor  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: TREB; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: Yes; About the Treborth Botanic Garden The site was originally developed as a pleasure garden by the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company in the 1840s. The garden was laid out to the design of Sir Joseph Paxton of Crystal Palace fame. It was to be part of Britannia Park, a Victorian extravaganza with Grand Hotel, conservatories and station on the main railway line. But due to funding problems, the whole scheme was abandoned and the site reverted to pasture and woodland.; ; In the 1960s, the then University College of North Wales bought the patch of woodland by the strait, together with the grassland above it, to develop a collection of plants for the Department of Botany. Parts of the old unimproved pasture now have a variety of management regimes to display the effects of these treatments on the native flora, while other parts have been developed to grow a wide range of wild and cultivated plants from all over the world that flourish in our mild climate with a relatively high rainfall and shelter from Atlantic gales. Several glasshouses give protection to less hardy species and a laboratory allows students and staff to examine plants on-site.; ; A feature of the garden is the diversity of habitats and soil types, supporting many native plants and animals. We encourage these by conserving a the range of grassland and woodland habitats. Part of the woodland is now a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). We also grow a collection of native plants from the mountain regions of Snowdonia and from coastal habitats in Wales. ; ; We plan to realise the potential of the Garden to provide enjoyment and information to the general public on how plants have evolved and how we interact with them. We envisage a visitor centre with catering and retail facilities, a new range of plant houses and a BioCentre supporting local businesses exploiting the findings of biological research.;  Main Address:; Treborth Botanic Garden; Bangor University; Bangor; Gwynedd, Wales LL57 2RQ United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 01248 353398; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treborthbotanicgarden.org/">http://www.treborthbotanicgarden.org/; Primary Email: n.j.chivers@bangor.ac.uk ;
