Manuel Gonzalez de Cosio        Despite the fact of Querétaro being only a small State in Central Mexico and unknown to many foreigners, its plants on the other hand, enjoy a worldwide recognition, primarily those of the semi-arid region.;  ;  Occupying 0.6% of the nation’s territory, with an extension of 11,769 squared kilometres, Querétaro is located between parallels 20° 01’ and 21°37’ and meridians 98° 54’ and 100° 35’. 7 hours from Greenwich Time Zone. The State possesses a rich biodiversity and it is for this reason, rather privileged. Its geography encompasses evergreen forests in the northeast, scrubs of various types (xerophilous) in the central and southern area, as well as temperate forest filled with oaks and pines and evergreen cloud forest in the peaks of the eastern side of the Sierra Madre. This territory is filled with a wide flora variation, nonetheless, it is not exempt from detrimental and destructive factors resulting from human impact; making the threat of extinction not only a real but also a permanent one. Among those species facing the greatest threat of extinction taxa of diverse of families are found, as well as specimens from all type of habitats; without a doubt, the family which has the largest number of species under threat of extinction is the cactacean family.;  ;  Although of recent foundation, Queretaro’s Botanical Gardens -founded only about 20 years ago, the first being founded in 1986-, have had ever since, a clear vision of their function as important propagation centers of endangered species and an awareness of their role in safeguarding vegetal germplasm of wild species. Because of the concern of local botanists, a large diversity of species with an important economic and ecological relevance have been reproduced in Querétaro even before a global strategy was declared and the first ecological laws provided the legal and institutional framework for this type of activities in Mexico.;  ;  Our Botanical Gardens have always strived for the implementation of endangered wild species propagation programs, as well as having a reproductive unit available on site. Although our efforts have focused in experimenting with and developing new techniques for the propagation of members of the cactacean family, throughout the years we have had the opportunity of experimenting with other botanical families as well.;                        Main Address:;         Jardin Botanico Regional de Cadereyta - Ing.
