However, the first chair of Botany was only established in 1788. In 1858 Francesco Tornabene Roccaforte, a benedectine and holder of the chair of Botany, eagerly laid the foundation of the Botanical Garden. The building was originally designed by the architect Mario Distefano, while Tornabene busied himself with the task of arranging the plants. In 1860 the Garden was extended thanks to a donation by Mario Coltraro; the new area was especially destined for the cultivation of wild sicilian species. ‘Cause a rapid growth of city no further expansion has been possible. From such a restriction an advantage has arisen, in that the original nineteenth-century plan could be maintained.;                        Main Address:;         Orto Botanico - Università degli Studi di Catania;         Via Antonino Longo 19;                Catania;        Sicilia 95125 Italy;        ;                 Telephone: 39 (0)95 430901;         Fax: 39 (0)95 441209;         URL: www.dipbot.unict.it;         Primary Email: orto.scuola@yahoo.it       ;
