Info:	  United Kingdom - West Sussex - Haywards Heath  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Nymans One of the great gardens of the Sussex Weald, offering a feast of colour throughout the year. Created by the Messel family over three generations from 1890. Originally it was planned around a pastiche "14th-century" manor house that was gutted by fire in 1947, and now forms a picturesque shell. The Messels intended to display as wide a variety of plants as possible from all over the world, dispatching plant hunters that included Harold, son of their head gardener, James Comber. The result is a magnificent collection of magnolias, rhododendrons, and other flowering trees and shrubs, including plants hybridised at Nymans such as Camellia "Leonard Messel". In high summer the double flower borders are a striking feature, while the garden is open at weekends throughout the winter.;  Main Address:; Nymans; Handcross; Haywards Heath; West Sussex RH17 6EB United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/nymans/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/nymans/; Primary Email: ;
