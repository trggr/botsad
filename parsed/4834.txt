Created by the Messel family over three generations from 1890. Originally it was planned around a pastiche "14th-century" manor house that was gutted by fire in 1947, and now forms a picturesque shell. The Messels intended to display as wide a variety of plants as possible from all over the world, dispatching plant hunters that included Harold, son of their head gardener, James Comber. The result is a magnificent collection of magnolias, rhododendrons, and other flowering trees and shrubs, including plants hybridised at Nymans such as Camellia "Leonard Messel". In high summer the double flower borders are a striking feature, while the garden is open at weekends throughout the winter.;                        Main Address:;         Nymans;         Handcross;                Haywards Heath;        West Sussex RH17 6EB United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/nymans/;         Primary Email:        ;
