In addition to visually stunning roses, the park features many gardens: the Main Rose Garden, the Heritage Garden with turn of the century roses, the Earth-Kind Rose Garden, the Herb Garden, and the Perennial Garden. Throughout the past 56 years, the Columbus Rose Park has garnered many honors, including being one of 133 All American Rose Selection gardens, selected as one of USA Today's 10 Places to Admire the Bloom on the Rose in 2006, and being one of Columbus' top wedding venues.
