8-alternative that, not only, benefits the environment, by not relying on fertilizers, but also produces a greater yield for the farmer. The second issue that is addressed is the health of communities. Moving away from fertilizers is healthier for the local public. Furthermore, the process is less strenuous which helps the aging agricultural population. Lastly, the procedure produces a more stable yield even when facing climate change. <table style="height: 296px

9-s an ecological restoration program was established by setting up a native tree nursery as a key facility. In collaboration with Hong Kong University (HKU) experiments were conducted to understand factors that limit the establishment and survival of native trees in grass- and shrublands. Much knowledge was gained about dispersal, recruitment, survival and growth rates of planted and naturally established tree species. Planting trials with native trees were successful and results were published over the last two decades (see publications by Richard Corlett and Billy Hau). <p style="text-align: center
