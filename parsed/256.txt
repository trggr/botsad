The original mission of the garden was research into the native flora of British Columbia.;  ;  Since that time, the mission of UBC Botanical Garden has broadened to include research, conservation, teaching and public display of temperate plants from around the world, particularly Asian, alpine and native plants.;  ;  The UBC Centre for Plant Research is the research arm of the UBC Botanical Garden. World-class research on topics including plant adaptation, evolution, genomics, plant physiology and biotic interactions, phytochemistry, plant biotechnology and plant breeding contribute to the University of British Columbia's reputation as one of the leading research institutions in North America.;                        Main Address:;         University of British Columbia Botanical Garden;         6804 S.W.
