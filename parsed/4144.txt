Wicklow, has been managed by the National Botanic Gardens since 1996. It is particularly famous for its conifers and calcifuges and was planted during the 19th Century by Thomas Acton in association with the curators of the National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin. During the early part of the twentieth century the estate passed from the hands of the Acton family and fell into a state of neglect. In 1970 the property was taken over by the land commission. A 58 acre portion comprising the house, arboretum, walled garden and entrance drive-way was handed over to the Forest and Wildlife Service. In 2010 it formerly received the title of National Botanic Gardens, Kilmacurragh.;                        Main Address:;         National Botanic Gardens, Kilmacurragh;         Kilbride,;                        Co Wicklow A67 YR12 Ireland;        ;                 Telephone: + 353 1 837 7596/ + 353 1 837 4388/ +353 1 804 0300;         Fax: + 353 1 836 0080;         URL: http://www.botanicgardens.ie/kilmac/kilmhome.htm;         Primary Email:        ;
