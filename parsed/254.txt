The new greenhouses (SILMU) were finished in 1998.;   ;  The greenhouses offer a journey to the Earth's different climate zones. On your journey you'll experience the heat and scents of the tropical houses, and see species ranging from tiny groundcover plants to the highest trees of the rainforest. Ornamental and useful subtropical plants bring a breath of Mediterranean air and the drought-resistant plants of the succulent house surprise with their ability to adapt. In the outdoor gardens you will see flowering plants from April to November. The mild winters of the southwestern coast allow some exotic species to thrive.;  ;  The landscape of the garden changes with the seasons, noticeably so in the autumn when the leaves change colour. The glorious colours of the annual plants transport the observer to more sunny climates. The garden of useful plants yields ideas to the home gardener.;  ;  There are 6 greenhouses: Cactus & Succulents, Araucaria, Neotropics, Palaeotropics, Mediterranean climate, Winter garden and outdoor garden is 24 hectares.;  ;  Scientists have access to research fields, greenhouses and laboratories which are suitable for a large variety of basic and applied biological research. The largest research fields of the outdoor garden are for research on birches.;                        Main Address:;         University of Turku - Botanic Garden;         Ruissalon puistotie 215;                Turku;        FI-20100 Finland;        ;                 Telephone: +358 50 4090151 (Office);         Fax: ;         URL: https://sites.utu.fi/kasvitieteellinen-puutarha/;         Primary Email: slaine@utu.fi       ;
