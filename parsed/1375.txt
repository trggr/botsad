Situated some 1.5 Km from the city centre, the garden overlooks Nairobi city. The garden aims to enhance learning of plant science by using habitat and systematic displays. Hard landscaping commenced in 1996, with the plant display house, a nursery and 2 Orchid houses. Seventeen thematic displays were proposed, ten themes are ready and work is still going on in the rest. As a visitor you will explore the ethno-botany and economic uses of plants on display. You will also learn about threats to plants their values, their habitats and techniquess in plant conservation.;                        Main Address:;         National Museums of Kenya,  Nairobi Botanic Garden;         P.O.Box 40658, NAIROBI, Kenya.;                Nairobi;        00100 Kenya;        ;                 Telephone: 254 02 742131/4, 742161/4;         Fax: 254 741424;         URL: www.museums.or.ke;         Primary Email: wwambugu@museums.or.ke       ;
