The NBR, is the first of the fourteen biosphere reserves of India. It provides habitat for about 110 strict endemics of plants.               The CZPCC would be a replica of the NBR, focusing on its flora and fauna. Ever since inception, it has been involved in various conservation related activities and has attracted many nature lovers and students.  An initiative towards this was the conduct of a Botanic Education workshop in collaboration with Zoo Outreach Organization and BGCI in 1995. The aim of this workshop was  to bring together zoos, botanic gardens, forest department, research institutions and NGOs, to work towards plant diversity.   In recognition of CZPCC work, the BGCI/NBRI awarded a grant under Investing in Nature-India to establish an Arboretum for endemic and endangered plants of the NBR and to promote conservation education.                         We routinely organize environment related educational programmes like nature camps, trekking, plants identification, quiz competitions etc., for school and college students. Apart form this, CZPCC has also conducted thematic programmes for teachers to promote biodiversity conservation. So far, about 5000 people have been trained on various issues of plant conservation. We at CZPCC truly believe that in the coming years, the organization would grow from strength to strength and will have a great impact on the nature lovers, students, researchers and the general public.;                        Main Address:;         Coimbatore Zoological Park Society;         Pioneer House;        Peelamedu;        Coimbatore;        Tamil Nadu 641 004 India;        ;                 Telephone: 91 422 2572222;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nilgiribiopark.com;         Primary Email: nbrpark@gmail.com       ;
