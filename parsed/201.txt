The hemlocks that once dominated the canopy began to decline early in the 20th century and have been nearly decimated in the last 30 years by two invasive insects:	hemlock woolly adelgid and elongate hemlock scale. Human-caused disturbances including soil compaction, over-collection of native plants, pollution, introduction of invasive species, fragmentation, loss of top predators, and climate change threaten the remaining native plant communities and habitats. Previous stewards, respectful of natural processes that created the Forest and informed by ecological theories of their times, preferred a &ldquo
