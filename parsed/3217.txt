Species from northern regions of the world as well as historic cultivars developed by pioneer plant breeders are on display. All specimens are labeled with common and scientific names. An invaluable reference for horticulture and botany, the picturesque site is also used for photography, field trips, and strolls.;  ;  The Arboretum is located in zone 2b of the hardiness zones of Canada, experiencing a sunny continental climate with cold snowy winters and hot summers. Despite climatic extremes many woody plants thrive here, responding to well-defined seasons and long hours of summer sunshine. ;  ;  The Arboretum began as a trial site in the 1960s, testing the adaptability of various trees, shrubs and vines to prairie conditions. The site was part of an ambitious prairie-wide experiment Prairie Regional Trials for Woody Ornamentals (PRTWO) coordinated by the Morden Research Station in Manitoba. The Saskatoon component of the experiment is significant as it experiences some of the coldest and hottest weather in the region. Although the PRTWO experiment ended in the year 2000, the arboretum remains a site of experimentation as new species are added annually while the original trees continue to mature.;  ;  The collection is curated and maintained by the Horticulture Field Facility of the Department of Plant Sciences, with some assistance from Meewasin Valley Authority.;  ;  The Arboretum is named in honour of Dr. Cecil F. Patterson, first head of the Department of Horticulture (now part of the Department of Plant Sciences) at the University of Saskatchewan. Dr. Patterson served the University for nearly fourty years and was instrumental in bringing horticulture to the people of the region, serving as professor, extension specialist, and plant breeder. One of Dr. Patterson's plum cultivars, 'Patterson Pride', has been planted in the Arboretum.;  ;  Patterson Garden Arboretum is a garden attraction of Canada's Garden Route. It is nearby to the campus area and is open to the public throughout the year, free of charge, from sunrise to sunset.;                        Main Address:;         Patterson Garden Arboretum;         University of Saskatchewan Department of Plant Sciences;        51 Campus Drive;        Saskatoon;        Saskatchewan S7N OWO Canada;        ;                 Telephone: (306) 966-5855;         Fax: (306) 966-5015;         URL: www.usask.ca;         Primary Email: jackie.bantle@usask.ca       ;
