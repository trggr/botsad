Info:	  United States of America - Florida - Jacksonville  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens For decades, Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens has given Jacksonville and Northeast Florida residents a place to love animals. Now our mission is to offer our community a public place to love plants, while setting a new standard for zoos in the process. We are in the process of building a first-of-its-kind botanical garden inside our Zoo that, unlike other zoos, is separate from the adjuncts to animals.; ; Unlike most other growing and culturally-rich cities, Jacksonville cannot list a botanical garden as one of its cultural treasures. Beyond filling an educational need, botanical gardens benefit their communities in many ways. They become tourist attractions, benefit the green industry, serve as an employer and pump millions of construction dollars and salaries into the regional economy.;  Main Address:; Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens; 370 Zoo Parkway; Jacksonville; Florida 32218 United States of America; ;  Telephone: (904) 757-4463; Fax: (904) 714-4441; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jaxzoo.org/botanical/">www.jaxzoo.org/botanical/; Primary Email: horticulture@jacksonvillezoo.org ;
