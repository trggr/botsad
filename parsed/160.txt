Without going far from home, you can inhale the fragrances of the Mediterranean, feel the cool shade of the redwood forest, delight in the glorious fall color of the northeastern United States, hear the rustle of the palm trees, take a break in a desert oasis, laugh at the funny forms of succulents, and breathe in the perfume of old fashioned roses.
