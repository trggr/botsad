The garden contains some uncommon trees including a Koelreuteria paniculata from north China. The Victorian Stumpery, hidden among the trees, boasts a collection of hexagonal stones from the Giant's Causeway. An herbaceous border planted with boldly coloured flowers fronts the north lawn. The orangery in the west wing protects lemon trees and agapanthus in the winter. The park surrounding the house contains some of the best examples of ancient specimen trees including oak, beech and hornbeam.
