The ornamental design and planting reflect the taste of Lady Churchill, especially the walled rose garden. Lovely water garden with white foxgloves. Water circulates through a series of ponds, cascades and a swimming pool before reaching the lakes. In 1958 a golden rose walk was created by their children to commemorate the Churchills' golden wedding. Productive kitchen garden has recently been lovingly restored.;                        Main Address:;         Chartwell;         Mapleton Road;                Westerham;        Kent TN16 1PS.
