Its origins go back to 1924 when “Vivero Nacional” a horticulture and forestry facility, was created, and its history is closely related with the history of the region and of the country as it was linked with the creation of the argentine protected areas system “Administracion de Parques Nacionales”, i.e the national parks administration, in 1934.;  ;  Nowadays it is home of a magnificent arboretum with more than 100 species, being one of the oldest, most diverse, and important arboreta in Argentina. It is also kwon for having one of most important conifers collection of South America. Many trees such as sequoias, eucalyptus and pines show an extraordinary development, both in height and diameter. ;  ;  Within the BG, the facility “Centro Forestal Ing. Agr. Alberto Suero” produces plants of native species and works, as well, as a biological station, for scientific research in the island.  Many educational and outreach projects are carried out, as well as programs of exotic plants control and native habitats restoration and rehabilitation. Moreover, as part of the Nahuel Huapi National Park, the BG has an important role in conservation, environmental education, scientific research, and outreach activities, as the island is an important touristic location receiving more than 350.000 visitors per year.  ;  ;  In recognition all these features, in January 2020 received the official national status of “Botanic Garden”.;                        Main Address:;         Jardín Botánico Isla Victoria;         Administracion de Parques Nacionales;        Av.
