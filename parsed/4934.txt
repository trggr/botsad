Characteristics from the original designs of this Victorian-inspired garden have been renewed, such as the elaborate symmetrical geometrical patterns of its plantings and pathways. The flat geometric design is punctuated with unique vertical ornamental material, such as topiary spruce, grafted weeping caragana and palms. New amenities include a garden-side caf√©, illuminated fountains and two outdoor reading rooms with wireless internet connections. In the early days, this park was the social and intellectual heart of the community and today it is a Provincial Historic Resource.;                        Main Address:;         Central Memorial Park;         City of Calgary Parks;        1221 2 St. S.W.;        Calgary;        Alberta T2R 0W9 Canada;        ;                 Telephone: ;         Fax: ;         URL: http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Parks/Pages/Locations/Downtown-parks/Central-Memorial-Park.aspx;         Primary Email:        ;
