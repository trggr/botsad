A naturally-occurring spring, or font, feeds into a tributary of the River Test. The former kitchen garden contains the National Collection of Shrub Roses (pre-1900), laid out by Graham Stuart Thomas in the 1970s and 1980s. Echoing the kitchen garden layout, he arranged the rose beds in four large plots with an outer boxed walk. The borders are planted with herbaceous plants chosen to complement the roses and extend the flowering season.;                        Main Address:;         Mottisfont Abbey Garden;         Mottisfont;                Romsey;        Hampshire SO51 0LP United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/mottisfont/;         Primary Email:        ;
