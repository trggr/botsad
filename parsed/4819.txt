It was laid out c.1820 when Hare Hill was built, although the main developments in the walled garden took place in the latter part of the 19th century. The delightful walled garden contains a pergola and wire sculptures. The area around the walled garden, although planted with some exotic species in the 19th century, was mainly developed in the last century by Colonel Charles Brocklehurst with advice from James Russell. The surrounding parkland has attractive walks, including a link path to Alderley Edge (2ml).;                        Main Address:;         Hare Hill;         Over Alderly;                Macclesfield;        Cheshire SK10 4QB.
