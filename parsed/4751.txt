For the convenience of the reader, we have included indexes of Latin synonyms and Ukrainian species names, the Law of the Red Book of Ukraine, the Little Red Book of Ukraine (vascular plants), and the Law on nature reserves in Ukraine.;  ;  The Catalogue will be useful for botanists, professors, students, and other specialists interested in studying the use and conservation of rare plants by Ukrainian botanic gardens and arboreta.;  ;  In general, we consider the Catalogue to be an interim step toward the creation of an electronic information retrieval system that is much more portable than printed material, and would allow easier changes and additions to the database on rare plant collections of botanical gardens and arboreta of Ukraine.;  ;  Idea and ordering – M.B.
