The main building was built between 1948 and 1957, when the Botanical Garden opened to the public, incorporating the National Herbarium of Venezuela and the Henri Pittier Library, both previously belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture. The Botanical Garden was declared a National Park in 1969. In 1980 both the Botanical Garden and the National Herbarium were assigned to the National Park Institute. In 2000, UNESCO declared the Universidad Central de Venezuela, together with the Caracas Botanical Garden, "Cultural Heritage of Humanity". In 2012 the Experimental Botanical Garden Institute "Dr. Tobías Lasser "(IEJB) was founded as part of the Universidad Central de Venezuela. The Garden is funded mainly by the University and to a lesser proportion by its own incomes and by donations. In this Garden, research, education, conservation and recreational activities are carried out.;                        Main Address:;         Instituto Experimental Jardin Botánico "Dr. Tobías Lasser";         Avenida Salvador Allende;        Ciudad Universitaria;        Caracas;        Distrito Capital 1040 Venezuela;        ;                 Telephone: 58-212-6053970 or 6053995;         Fax: ;         URL: www.ucv.ve/fibv.htm;         Primary Email: instituto.jardin@gmail.com       ;
