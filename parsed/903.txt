The comfortable cool weather that prevails throughout the year compliments the exotic flora and fauna, creating a true paradise.;  ;  According to the legends, the history of Hakgala Gardens dates back to the time of Ramayanaya; an epic love story of the east. Queen Sita, captured and brought to Sri Lanka, is said to have been hidden in this vicinity - the Hakgala Gardens at that time was one of the pleasure gardens of King Ravana.;  ;  The present day Hakgala Gardens was established in 1861 under the patronage of Dr G H W Thawaites. Originally it was used for the cultivation of cinchona and later for tea. The development of Hakgala Gardens as a botanic garden was initiated by Mr William Nock and since then many varieties of flowers and trees, both local and foreign, have been introduced.;  ;  A network of small creeks, complete with wooden bridges, is seen throughout the garden, creating a magical atmosphere. The magnificent rose garden, conifers, cedars, cypresses, variety of pines and English oak are just a few examples of the diversity of plant life that is seen here.;                        Main Address:;         Hakgala Botanic Gardens;                         Hakgala;        Sri Lanka;        ;                 Telephone: +94 52 2182;         Fax: ;         URL: http://botanicgardens.gov.lk;         Primary Email: dirnbg@sltnet.lk       ;
