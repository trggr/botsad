The mansion, an extraordinary Gothic Revival extravaganza bristling with towers and turrets, survives with much of its original Victorian interior intact, an unrivalled collection of Victorian decorative arts, an insight into life below stairs and a sumptuously decorated private chapel. Its surrounding 200ha (500 acres) of land include formal gardens and a wonderful walled kitchen garden. Tyntesfield was saved for the nation by the National Trust in June 2002 with funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, other heritage partners and a GBP3 million public appeal.;                        Main Address:;         Tyntesfield;                         Wraxhall;        North Somerset BS48 1NT United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tyntesfield/;         Primary Email:        ;
