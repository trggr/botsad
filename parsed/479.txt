Special Collections:	The actual work done by the Botanical Garden is mainly research, teaching and the conservation of rare species or those at risk of extinction besides the cultivation and presentation of museum collections and the organization of artistic and cultural exhibitions.
The research done by the Botanical Garden is principally the study of the macro and micromorphological characteristics of some groups of plants for example:	cycadales and orchidaceae, ethnobotanical researches in rural areas of central and southern Italy and the analysing of vegetable fossils from geographical sites in the Campania region. Furthermore it is clear that the collections of the Botanical Garden represent a reservoir of vegetal substances used for studies purposes by researchers in the Plant Biology Section of the Department of Biological Science.
