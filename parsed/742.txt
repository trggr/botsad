As Secrest continues to discover and develop solutions to landscape problems, it is critical to update our collections. Secrest is already home to thousands of native and introduced species and cultivars of trees, shrubs, and other plants, and with the help of the Friends of Secrest Arboretum, we will help establish new and improved programs for research, education, and natural beauty and continue to be a unique resource in Ohio.;                        Main Address:;         Secrest Arboretum;         Ohio State University;        1680 Madison Avenue;        Wooster;        Ohio 44691 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (330) 263-3761;         Fax: (330) 263-3767;         URL: www.secrest.osu.edu;         Primary Email: cochran.7@osu.edu       ;
