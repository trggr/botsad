9-As a part of the Program Durban Botanic Garden chose to focus their involvement on the 17, 000 young people growing up in this difficult, disruptive area. Through Chapter 1 of its Citizen Education Project the garden was active in over 30 primary schools, inviting them to the garden to take part in educational, environmental activities. <table style="margin-left: auto

9-DBG</strong> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Impact: </strong> The project has had an impressive impact with nearly all schools in the INK area participating in activities at the garden. The most significant impact of the project was the exposure of learners to the garden itself and seeing them interact with nature and learn to love and appreciate it. This was seen by the garden staff carrying out the activities but was also fed back through the evaluation forms and interviews from both the pupils and teachers.&nbsp
