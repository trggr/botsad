It has about 112,000 accessions which are available for use. Canada signed and ratified the FAO International Plant Treaty to facilitate use of the germplasm. Canada uses the SMTA of the Treaty in all its distributions. PGRC covers many of the important fuctions of gene banks including acquiring, maintaining, conserving, distributing, regenerating, characterizing, evaluating and documenting germplasm of plant species of importance to food and agriculture. PGRC also has a program to acquire and conserve native plant species existing within Canada.;  Main Address:; Plant Gene Resources of Canada; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Saskatoon Research Centre, 107 Science Place; Saskatoon; Saskatchewan S7N 0X2 Canada; ;  Telephone: (306) 956-7641; Fax: (306) 956-7246; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://pgrc3.agr.gc.ca">http://pgrc3.agr.gc.ca; Primary Email: Ken.Richards@agr.gc.ca ;
