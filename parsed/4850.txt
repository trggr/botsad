At the heart is the tranquil garden, set on many levels and containing a superb collection of tender and exotic plants which give colour throughout the year. The display of spring-flowering plants and shrubs is particularly spectacular. Drifts of daffodils and narcissus in spring are followed by wild flowers in summer. Features include a wildlife pond, several thatched summer-houses and a traditional Cornish apple orchard containing many original varieties, some nearly extinct. The house is not open but there is an art and craft gallery, and a fine Georgian stable block. There is also a Celtic Cross and a sensory garden for visually-impaired visitors.
