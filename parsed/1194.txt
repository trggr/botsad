Info:	  United States of America - South Carolina - Charleston  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: MAGPG; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Magnolia Plantation and Gardens The gardens at Magnolia Plantation are of such beauty and variety that they have brought tourists from around the world to view them since they were open to the public in the early 1870s. However, many parts of the gardens are much older, some sections more than 325 years old, making them the oldest unrestored gardens in America. As the plantation has stayed within the ownership of the same family for more than three centuries, each generation has added their own personal touch to the gardens, expanding and adding to their variety. Today there are a large variety of flowers blossoming year round, with the climax of incredible beauty building towards the spring bloom.;  Main Address:; Magnolia Plantation and Gardens; 3550 Ashley River Road; Charleston; South Carolina 29414 United States of America; ;  Telephone: (800) 367-3517; Fax: (843) 571-5346; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magnoliaplantation.com">www.magnoliaplantation.com; Primary Email: camelliaman@msn.com ;
