Info:	  United States of America - California - Berkeley  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: RPBG; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Regional Parks Botanic Garden The Regional Parks Botanic Garden is a naturally beautiful and tranquil living museum of California native plants. Located within Tilden Park in the hills above Berkeley, California, this enchanting 10-acre garden is a sanctuary for many of the state's rare and endangered plants and a place for visitors to wander among trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses from plant communities throughout the state.; ; In the garden's many habitats are species from the High Sierra to the serpentine barrens of the Coast Ranges, and from the northern rain forests to the southern deserts. Flowers bloom every month of the year, reaching a spectacular peak in spring through midsummer. In the fall and winter, the garden is decorated with the vibrant hues of ripening fruits, changing leaves, and colorful twigs. A year-round creek runs through the heart of the garden, adding beauty, creating a riparian corridor, and providing additional habitat for the many birds, insects, and other animals that visit and live in the garden.; ; The garden's primary role is to create beautiful landscapes displaying California's diverse plant life. Its mission embraces not only aesthetics, but also native plant conservation, public education, and horticultural experimentation designed to bring new native plants into the nursery trade.; ; Since the garden's establishment in 1940, its collection has grown to include thousands of plant species and varieties, many identified with interpretive labels. Notable among the specimens from all corners of the state are some of the broadest representations of California's unique plant groups. These include nearly all of California's conifers and oaks as well as collections of California manzanitas (Arctostaphylos), wild lilacs (Ceanothus), grasses, aquatic plants, and flowering bulbs that are among the most complete to be found anywhere.;  Main Address:; Regional Parks Botanic Garden; Tilden Regional Park; Physical: Wildcat Canyon Road and South Park Drive; Berkeley; California 94701 United States of America; ;  Telephone: (510) 544-3169; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nativeplants.org">www.nativeplants.org; Primary Email: bgarden@ebparks.org ;
