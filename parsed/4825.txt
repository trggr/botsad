Later, Veitch founded a famous firm of nurserymen which sent plant hunters (including the Lobb brothers and Ernest Wilson) all over the world to bring back new species, many of which found a home in Killerton garden. The garden was developed by successive generations of the Acland family. In the 1920s Sir Frances Acland, 14th Baronet, supported Captain Kingdon-Ward's plant-hunting expeditions to the Himalayas, which brought new rhododendron species to Killerton. The herbaceous border and terrace were laid out in the early 20th century by William Robinson.;  Main Address:; Killerton; Broadclyst; Exeter; Devon EX5 3LE United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton/; Primary Email: ;
