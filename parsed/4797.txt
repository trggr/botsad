A contemporary of Darwin with whom he corresponded, Bateman designed the garden to provide a showcase for his plant collection gathered from different parts of the world. The garden is designed as a series of compartments and includes areas representing different countries such as Egypt, Italy and a Himalayan Glen, culminating in the magnificent China. Here grows the Golden Larch, the survivor of a group which Robert Fortune brought back from a trip to that country. It is believed to be the oldest specimen of the tree growing in Britain and is rare in cultivation. The highly accurate restoration was achieved using information gleaned from drawings, early photographs and descriptions in articles published in journals of the day.;  Main Address:; Biddulph Grange Garden; Grange Road; Biddulph; Staffordshire ST8 7SD United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/biddulph-grange-garden/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/biddulph-grange-garden/; Primary Email: ;
