Short term seed collections support the living collections and nursery with stock of new and replacement native plant species for display, while long term conservation collections are stored to assist in safeguarding Australian native plants. By conducting research the National Seed Bank team is also extending the breadth of knowledge on how to collect, process, store and germinate native seeds as we increase the number of different plant species held in our bank.;  ;  The National Seed Bank holds around 5,500 accessions (individual seed collections, normally stored in a single packet) from more than 3,000 different plant taxa, with a history of collections going back to the early 1960â€™s.;  ;  The National Seed Bank has focused seed collecting efforts on plant species endemic to the local alpine, subalpine and grasslands regions. Work has been fuelled by the increasing threat of climate change and human impact upon Australian alpine flora. Between 2007 and 2012, more than 451 alpine seed collections were successfully banked at the ANBG in partnership with researchers at the Australian National University (ANU), including approximately 148 species from 80+ genera ensuring we have future options for saving these species.;                        Main Address:;         National Seed Bank - Australian National Botanic Gardens;         GPO Box 1777;                Canberra;        Australian Capital Territory 2601 Australia;        ;                 Telephone: (02) 6250 9450;         Fax: (02) 6250 9599;         URL: http://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/living/seedbank/;         Primary Email: thomas.north@environment.gov.au       ;
