Info:	  United Kingdom - Derbyshire - Derby  ;Garden Information;  Institution Code: ; International Agenda Registration: No; BGCI Member: No; About the Kedleston Hall Pleasure grounds and landscape park laid out by 1st Lord Scarsdale with designs and buildings by Robert Adam. A 3.5-mile walk swings round to the south of the house, giving extensive views. The pleasure grounds underwent some formalisation at the end of the 19th century and between 1922 and 1924 when Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll advised. Present planting re-establishes the 18th-century feel, with contemporary garden buildings and monuments, including the orangery (c.1800) and hexagonal summerhouse, lying within the grounds, which are planted with rhododendrons, shrubs and species trees. In the park further buildings, including the bridge and cascade, together with the fishing pavilion, are also the work of Robert Adam. Fine specimens of Fagus sylvatica 'Asplenifolia' and Tilia platyphyllos.;  Main Address:; Kedleston Hall; Derby; Derbyshire DE22 5JH United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/kedleston/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/kedleston/; Primary Email: ;
