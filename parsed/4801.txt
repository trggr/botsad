Recognised as one of the best surviving formal layouts in the style of George London and Henry Wise, and a considerable influence on the Lutyens-Gertrude Jekyll generation of gardeners. Derelict and overgrown when rescued by the National Trust, the restoration work of the 1980s is maturing. The garden is divided by stone walls and yew hedges into courts with terraces and topiary. Early 18th-century timber gates and garden seats together with fine Cedar of Lebanon. In the Green Court is a lead statue of a shepherd boy attributed to Jan van Nost (early 18th century). Old fruit varieties including plums, pears and apples of the same varieties as found in the Mary Rose. Terracing, mixed rose and herbaceous borders, mulberry border. Culinary and medicinal herb border.;                        Main Address:;         Canons Ashby House;         Canons Ashby;                Daventry;        Northamptonshire NN11 3SD United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/canons-ashby-house/;         Primary Email:        ;
