The gardens are the result of the ideas and vision of Margaret Beale, echoing the informal beauty of the William Morris wallpapers that decorate the house. They are set on several levels, with magnificent views over the valley, enabling visitors to stroll through the Bamboo garden, Rose garden, Rhododendron dell, and the Quarry garden with its newly restored bridge. The woodland walk, through nearby Hollybush wood, is a haven for bluebells and other wild flowers.;                        Main Address:;         Standen;         West Hoathly Road;                East Grinstead;        West Sussex RH19 4NE United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/standen/;         Primary Email:        ;
