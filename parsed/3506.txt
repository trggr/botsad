These early plantings initially supported undergraduate coursework and evolved over time into gardens.;  ;  Today, the UD Botanic Garden is a series of twelve gardens on fifteen acres. UDBG continues to be used by faculty, students, Green Industry professionals, and the public, and serves a primary role in supporting the CANR programs in horticulture, plant science, entomology, and landscape design.;  ;  UD Botanic Gardens contributes to an understanding of the changing relationships between plants and people through education, extension, research, and community support.;                        Main Address:;         University of Delaware Botanic Gardens;         531 South College Avenue;        Mailing: 152 Townsend Hall, Plant & Soil Sciences;        Newark;        Delaware 19717 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (302) 831-0153;         Fax: (302) 831-0605;         URL: http://ag.udel.edu/udbg/;         Primary Email:        ;
