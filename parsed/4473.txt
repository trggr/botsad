A committee was established to begin planning the design and construction of the gardens. Early in the process the committee recommended that the campus first be declared a Display Garden, followed by work to add sufficient plantings, features, staff and expertise over a series of years to further develop the campus into a Botanical Garden.; ; The dedication of the first ten themed gardens on September 21, 2007, is one of several contributions from the university in celebration of the Oklahoma Centennial. These gardens are only the beginning of an expanded group of gardens that will be enjoyed by visitors to campus and will serve as a resource for educating students and the public about botany, ecology, horticulture, conservation, landscaping, and therapeutic uses of plants and gardens.;  Main Address:; Central Gardens of UCO; University of Central Oklahoma; 100 North University Drive; Edmond; Oklahoma 73034 United States of America; ;  Telephone: (405) 974-2247; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uco.edu/administration/green/gardens">www.uco.edu/administration/green/gardens; Primary Email: ttillman2@uco.edu ;
