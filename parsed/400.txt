The existence of a palace with a simple garden is first recorded in a pen and ink drawing dated 1578. In the 17th Century, one of the most splendid gardens of the time was laid out, including orangeries (the forerunners of greenhouses). In the 18th Century, the baroque Clemensruh Palace (Poppelsdorfer Schloss) was built (c. 1740-47). ;  ;  The botanic garden as we know it dates from the foundation of the University of Bonn in 1818, and its boundaries coincide closely with the former palace park. The botanic garden's founder and first director (1818-30) was Nees von Esenbeck. ;  ;  The total area is 6 ha (15 acres) of which greenhouses occupy 0.25 ha (about 0.6 acres). In addition we have a separate area in the Melb valley which is not open to the public. ;  ;  In 2002, the Economic Plants Garden(formerly Landwirtschaftlich-Botanischer Garten) and the Palace garden were fused to form a new department: Bonn University Botanic Gardens.;                        Main Address:;         Botanische Gärten der Universität Bonn;         Meckenheimer Allee 171;                Bonn;        D-53115 Germany - Deutschland;        ;                 Telephone: 49 (0)228 73 5523;         Fax: 49 (0)228 73 9058;         URL: www.botgart.uni-bonn.de;         Primary Email: botgart@uni-bonn.de       ;
