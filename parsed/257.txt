The arrangement of the outdoor collections is primarily geographic by continent of origin or by region including Asia, Australasia, California, Deserts of the Americas, Eastern North America, Mediterranean, Mexico/Central America, South America, and Southern Africa. The Garden holds one of the largest and most diverse collections in the United States. ;  ;  California native plants (over 2,750 accesssions) occupy approximately one-third of the Garden's area and are grouped by plant communities. These include over a quarter of the state's native species (according to The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California) and 201 taxa on the California Native Plant Society's list of rare and endangered species.;                        Main Address:;         University of California Botanical Garden at Berkeley;         200 Centennial Drive #5045;                Berkeley;        California 94720-5045 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (510) 643-2755;         Fax: (510) 642-3012;         URL: http://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu;         Primary Email: garden@berkeley.edu       ;
