The arrangement of the outdoor collections is primarily geographic by continent of origin or by region including Asia, Australasia, California, Deserts of the Americas, Eastern North America, Mediterranean, Mexico/Central America, South America, and Southern Africa. The Garden holds one of the largest and most diverse collections in the United States. ; ; California native plants (over 2,750 accesssions) occupy approximately one-third of the Garden's area and are grouped by plant communities.
