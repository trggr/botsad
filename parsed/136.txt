Its first plant list and plan have been preserved, and a reconstruction of our earliest garden has been laid out in its original place. It has always been part of Leiden University, and is now also a registered museum. It's most important research collection is the Orchid collection, but tropical ferns, cycads, Hoya, Dischidia, Aeschynanthus, myrmecophytes, and hardy ferns are also substantial research collections.
