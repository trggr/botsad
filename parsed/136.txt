Its first plant list and plan have been preserved, and a reconstruction of our earliest garden has been laid out in its original place. It has always been part of Leiden University, and is now also a registered museum. It's most important research collection is the Orchid collection, but tropical ferns, cycads, Hoya, Dischidia, Aeschynanthus, myrmecophytes, and hardy ferns are also substantial research collections. The collection data are stored in a recently developed Living Collections module of BRAHMS.;  http://www.hortusleiden.nl/index.php/english/;                        Main Address:;         Hortus botanicus Leiden;         P.O.
