In the southwestern Apennine Alps, Alpine, Central European, Illyrian, and submediterranean floras intermingle, and one can even find some eumediterranean plants, while Eastern European or Pannonian plants are almost completely absent.;  ;  It was the founding of the Juliana Botanical Garden in 1926, approximately the time as the Alpine Conservation Park in the Valley of the Triglav Lakes was being planned, that led to the first alpine botanical garden located in a natural environment in Slovenia.;                        Main Address:;         Juliana Alpine Botanical Garden;         Trenta valley;        Mailing: Slovenian Museum of Natural History, Presernova 20, Ljubljana 1000;        Trenta;        5232 Slovenia;        ;                 Telephone: 386 12 410 940;         Fax: 386 12 410 953;         URL: http://www.pms-lj.si/juliana/en/;         Primary Email: uprava@pms-lj.si       ;
