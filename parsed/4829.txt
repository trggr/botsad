Many of the woodlands have been replanted, but there are still interesting semi-natural oak, hazel and alder woods, and some actively worked hazel coppice. The prospect house Leith Hill Tower, built in 1765, dominates the hilltop, and commands magnificent views across the North Downs and London to the north and the South Downs and English Channel to the south. On the southern slopes of the hill is the Rhododendron Wood, a mass of colour in spring and early summer. Many of the woodlands contain plants which indicate their antiquity, particularly parts of Mosses Wood and Frank's Wood. The oak and hazel conceal a ground flora of typical woodland herbs such as yellow archangel, wood spurge and sweet woodruff. The elusive white admiral butterfly can be seen. In spring, both Mosses and Frank's Woods have a spectacular display of bluebells. Woodland birds include nuthatch, treecreeper and nightingale, and the open heathland is home to tree pipits, woodlarks, nightjars and reptiles such as the common lizard and adder.
