With a long history of impressive botanically-minded owners, the garden boasts a large collection of rhododendrons and thousands of trees - some of which are recorded as the tallest of their kind in Britain. Herbaceous woodland plants such as Meconopsis (Himalayan poppy), Rogersiana, Ligularia, Hosta & Astillbe also grow well here.;                        Main Address:;         Dawyck Botanic Garden;         Stobo;                Stobo;        Peeblesshire EH45 9JU United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: +44 (0) 1721 760 254;         Fax: 01721 760214;         URL: www.rbge.org.uk;         Primary Email: dawyck@rbge.org.uk       ;
