However, since 1970, it has acted as the Department for Crop Germplasm Conservation of the Institute of Plant Genetics. ;  ;  In the last 15 years, new gardens of ornamental plants including bulb plants and roses, a big rock garden devoted to Polish mountainous plants and new modern greenhouses (1 300 m2) for tropical, subtropical and desert plants have been opened to public visitors.;  ;  The Botanical Garden of the Polish Academy of Sciences (BG PAS) is a special institution of broad activity. On one hand, BG PAS is a research institution dealing with plants in the areas of botany, physiology biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, biotechnology, ecology and horticultural sciences. On the other hand, the garden serves to the public as an institution for popularization of knowledge about plants, an education centre and a place of recreation.;  ;  In 1997 the Presidium of the Polish Academy of Sciences changed the name to Botanical Garden – Centre for Biological Diversity Conservation. This new name better reflects the specificity and activity of this institution.;                        Main Address:;         Polish Academy of Sciences Botanical Garden Center for Biological Diversity Conservation in Powsin;         ul.
