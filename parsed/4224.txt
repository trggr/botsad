A tropical environment with ample rain allows most trees to retain their leaves in the dry season (December through late May). It is home to many endangered and threatened flora and fauna. Tropical forests of the world hold at least half of all the variety of life on Earth. Moreover, the species found with the Caribbean are among the richest in plant and animal life on the planet.;  ;  The Key West Forest & Garden is a special place where you can appreciate biodiversity and learn more about its importance. For instance, the forest has two of the last remaining fresh water ponds in the Keys and is a major migratory stopping point for neo-tropical birds from places as far as South America, as well as being home to many rare birds in the Florida Keys.;  ;  There is a lot to explore, and this website is to help you keep up-to-date with our mission: to discover, preserve and expand the unique treasures of this region that this one of a kind, tropical forest and garden has to offer.;                        Main Address:;         Key West Tropical Forest & Botanical Garden;         5210 College Road;                Key West;        Florida 33040 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (305) 296-1504;         Fax: (305) 296-2242;         URL: https://www.keywest.garden/;         Primary Email:        ;
