It is supposed to help maintain and develop tree species endangered at their natural stands.  ;  ;  For the uninitiated:  ;  The Arboretum is - as for a globetrotter - an opportunity to learn about trees and shrubs of other continents and countries. People interested in dendrology, forestry or horticulture meet new and versatile forest aspects that contribute to the diversity of forests and to the enrichment of landscapes. For native but so far unnoticed or mostly ignored tree and shrub species, e.g. Yew or Service Tree the Arboretum should be conducive.  ;  Tree species diversity of comparable geographical latitudes is strikingly higher in America or Eastern Asia than in Europe. The reason for this was the evasive movement of tree species during the Ice Age and their later remigration. On the European Continent remigration was - because of the East-West-extension of the Alps - either infeasible or possible only on a small scale. Many tree species that are going to be reintroduced today had been native before the Ice Age Period, e.g. Big Tree (Sequoiadendron giganteum), Red Cedar (Thuja plicata), Yellow Poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and others. From this point of view, reintroducing does not mean cultivating "foreign tree species" but the return of former native species. This is what the Arboretum wants to contribute to.;                        Main Address:;         Arboretum Freiburg-Günterstal;         Municipal Forest District of Freiburg;        Haus Nr. 31, 79283 Ulrich/Bollschweil St.;        Freiburg;        D-79104 Germany - Deutschland;        ;                 Telephone: +49 (0) 7602-920309;         Fax: +49 (0) 7602-920319;         URL: http://www.biologie.uni-ulm.de/extern/guenterstal/;         Primary Email: hubertus.nimsch@t-online.de       ;
