In order to secure the viability and sustainability of our work we were led to the foundation of the non-profit organisation “Hippocrates 2500 years”, which will ensure the success, development and evolution of the Hippocrates Garden. Ultimately we envision to handover a social, environmental and cultural heritage that we have only temporarily borrowed from the future generations of the world.;                        Main Address:;         Hippocrates Botanical Garden of Kos;         Industrial Park of Markopoulo Mesogaias;                Kos;        Athens 19003 Greece;        ;                 Telephone: +30 210 2854415;         Fax: +30 210 2843580;         URL: https://www.hbgk.gr;         Primary Email: kamilakis-i@apivita.gr       ;
