Our long-term commitment is not only focused at researching, studying, promoting and disseminating Hippocrates’s work, but it largely involves a higher cause:	the creation of a cultural focal point and the establishment of a modern Noah’s arc and an international renowned research centre of Hippocratic plants. In order to secure the viability and sustainability of our work we were led to the foundation of the non-profit organisation “Hippocrates 2500 years”, which will ensure the success, development and evolution of the Hippocrates Garden. Ultimately we envision to handover a social, environmental and cultural heritage that we have only temporarily borrowed from the future generations of the world.
