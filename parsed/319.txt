8-"><strong>Yves Nathan Mekembom</strong>, Technical and Research Officer, <a href="mailto: mekembom@yahoo.fr" target="_blank">mekembom@yahoo.fr</a>
8-">Limbe Botanic Garden has seen an increase in attendance as a result of the project, with visitors wanting to find out more about flower production and GAP. <h3 style="text-align: justify
8-">The CFIDP has since created a new farming system in the region. GAP are now being implemented by nearly all farmers, and flower production has become another source of income for communities. <p style="text-align: justify
8-">The Community-Based Floriculture Industry Development Project (CFIDP) aims to understand the cost at and scale to which it is possible for Cameroon to develop a strong floriculture industry. <p style="text-align: justify
8-">The landscape has also been transformed. Areas once covered by weeds have now become flower farms, and destructive erosion has been reduced in hilly regions. In addition, some native species and plants that were previously identified as weeds have now been introduced to the list of cut-flowers and have the potential to be sold worldwide. <p style="text-align: justify
8-">The local economy has benefited and the livelihoods of individuals have improved. Some farmers have themselves been able to hire unemployed members of the community, giving these people the opportunity to earn money and learn about the plants being grown. <p style="text-align: justify
