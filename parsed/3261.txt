Set aside in 1968, this preserve is home to over 160 species of prairie plants and a great array of prairie wildlife. Prior to European settlement, tall grass prairie covered one million square kilometres in central North America, stretching from Texas to southern Manitoba. Today, tall grass prairie is all but gone. In Manitoba only 1/20th of 1% of the original tall grass prairie remains. The Living Prairie Museum is one of the few remaining fragments of this once vast ecosystem.; ; ; The goal of Living Prairie Museum is to provide awareness and conservation of natural areas, specifically tall grass prairie, through environmental education.;  Main Address:; Living Prairie Museum; 2795 Ness Avenue; Winnipeg; Manitoba R3J 3S4 Canada; ;  Telephone: (204) 832-0167; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/naturalist/livingprairie/">http://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/naturalist/livingprairie/; Primary Email: ;
