A variety of annual and perennial flowerbeds and spectacular herbaceous borders including the Summer-house Garden which has been transformed into an Edwardian-style flower garden with beds designed to reflect the architectural floor plan of the summer-house - one of the oldest garden buildings in the country, c.1632-36. The orchard and Edwardian Wild Garden provide a delightfully informal contrast, and there are also attractive lakeside and woodland walks. Good collection of ancient trees, including the "Hundred Guinea Oak" believed to be around 650 years old.;  Main Address:; The Vyne; Sherborne St John; Basingstoke; Hampshire RG24 9HL United Kingdom; ;  Telephone: 07786661602; Fax: ; URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/vyne/">www.nationaltrust.org.uk/vyne/; Primary Email: ;
