Ely built her gardens surrounding the main residence at Meadowburn over the course of a forty-year period with the help of her loyal gardener, Albert Furman. Through trial and error she developed the practical hands-on horticultural knowledge that informed and inspired  her three widely influential books on hardy gardening. In her day, Helena Rutherfurd Ely was considered one of the premier garden experts in America and her gardens at Meadowburn were recognized as among the finest in the country.;  ;  The gardens today provide a unique opportunity for the public to learn from Helena Rutherfurd Ely’s design and practices as an important living artifact in America’s gardening narrative.;                        Main Address:;         Meadowburn Farm;         42 Meadow Burn Road;                Vernon Township;        New Jersey 07462 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (206) 788-5607;         Fax: ;         URL: www.
