It was established by Rucore in 1990 as a rural development project designed to develop a deeper understanding of solutions for sustainability rooted in the South African context. The work carried out at the Tlholego Village has been shaped primarily by: social questions of historic inequalities; economic development and livelihoods; as well as the pressing environmental forces of climate change and constraints of fossil fuel based energy system. The purpose of this work has been to develop an integrated approach to sustainability in rural development that is informed by global practice and the local reality.;  ;   ;  ;  In the past 20 years, the organisation’s project driven and practical approach towards sustainable development has resulted in the creation of an established learning centre where training, research and development are facilitated. Since its inception over 500 people have been trained and more than 3000 people have visited the centre. Organic farming, permaculture and sustainable construction have been the focus of the learning centre’s training programmes. The work around sustainable construction has been related to the creation of a residential development consisting of affordable, environmentally sound infrastructure that includes local self-reliance, food security, water management and energy resources. Much of the training and education has focused on capacity building for local economic development informed by sound principles of sustainability.;                        Main Address:;         Tlholego Ecovillage and Learning Centre;         P.O.
