This area is at the entrance to the Fernkloof Nature Reserve, an 1800 hectare declared nature reserve, on the mountain and coastal areas of Hermanus, Western Cape. The main veld type of the FNR is Overberg Sandstone Fynbos, a critically endangered veld-type, of great conservation concern. The HBS members have built a botanical centre on the leased area consisting of herbarium, hall and kitchen, office, research centre, visitorsâ€™ centre and indigenous nursery.
