8-">The Morton Arboretum is the site of numerous restoration projects. This includes the restoration of a 40 hectare tallgrass prairie and savanna which is one of the oldest tallgrass restoration projects in the United States. The Schulenberg Prairie and Savanna was established in 1962 and has developed over the decades to include over 500 plant species, including the introduction of 9 endangered species. The propagule sources for this restoration all came from within 80 kilometres of the restoration site, many of which have been subsequently demolished due to development and urban sprawl. The high species richness of this restoration also ranks similarly to local prairie remnants, a feat which is incredibly difficult to attain in tallgrass prairie restorations. <p style="text-align: center
