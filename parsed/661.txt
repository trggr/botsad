Carvill developed a design to replace the tilled fields, woodlots and pastures, using trees to frame and complement open spaces.  He bordered the lanes with alleés of trees and planted groups of trees in odd numbers.  Carvill also constructed grape arbors and a serpentine walk, reflecting the English landscape tradition of Sir Humphrey Repton. Carvill’s mark is still evident today in the pastoral landscape which includes several original trees including a Swamp white oak, Quercus bicolor, and Bur oak, Quercus macrocarpa, on Founders Green.;  ;  In 1901, a group of students and alumni formed the Campus Club to help preserve the campus landscape after discovering Carvill’s original plan.  Their work eventually led to the founding of the Haverford College Campus Arboretum Association (now the Haverford College Arboretum Association) in 1974, which continues to perpetuate Carvill’s original design.;                        Main Address:;         Haverford College Arboretum;         Haverford College;        370 Lancaster Avenue;        Haverford;        Pennsylvania 19041 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (610) 896-1101;         Fax: (610) 896-1095;         URL: www.haverford.edu/Arboretum;         Primary Email: arbor@haverford.edu       ;
