It was renamed South China Institute of Botany, CAS in 1954, and then to its present name in 2003 in compliancewith a new CAS developmental plan. ;  ;  As one of the top botany research institutions in China, SCBG has obtained abundant research achievements in the fields of ecology, systematic and evolutionary botany, plant resources, biotechnology, as well as landscape and gardening. Since 1954, about 375 monographs have been compiled and published by SCBG, mainly including Flora of China, The Vegetation of Guangdong, Studies on the Tropical and Subtropical Degraded Ecosystem and Its Rehabilitation, Rare Plants of China, Introduction to Restoration Ecology etc. Until the end of 2015, over 2440 scientific papers have been published in internationally peer-reviewed journals including “Nature” and “Science”; 390 research achievements have been obtained, of which 285 were awarded prizes at various levels, including a first and a second prizes of National Natural Science Award, and five second prizes of National Science and Technology Advance Awards. The research achievements were twice honored as "Top Ten Basic Research News in China" in 2000 and 2006, respectively. In total 285 patents have been filed, of which 153 have been licensed. In addition, 88 new plant varieties have been validated or registered internationally since 1988.;  ;  As one of the largest comprehensive botanical gardens in China, SCBG consists of three divisions: 1) The nursery and exhibition zone.  With an area of 282 ha, it was designed mainly for plant ex-situ conservation with more than 14,000 plant taxa growing in 37 special living collections, including magnolias, bamboos, palms, gingers, orchids, medicinal plants, etc.; 2) The research zone.With an area of 37 ha, it features a herbarium holding more than 1,100,000 dried plant specimens,  four research centers and several key laboratories; and 3) The Dinghushan National Nature Reserve.Established in 1956， it is the first national nature reserve in China and the only reserve affiliated to CAS. Over 2,400 plant species are in situ conserved in an area of 1,155ha. In addition, SCBG runs three field research stations, including Dinghushan National Field Research Station of Forest Ecosystem, Heshan National Field Research Station of Forest Ecosystem, and Xiaoliang CAS Field Research Station for Restoration of Tropical Coastal Degraded Ecosystem.;  ;  At present, SCBG has 402 staff members, including 307 professional researchers. SCBG offers Master’s and Ph.D programmes in botany, ecology, as well as biochemistry & molecular biology. SCBG also offers Master’s programme in ornamental plants & gardening, and biological engineering.  At present, 213 Master students and 150 Ph.D students are enrolled. In addition, 32 postdoctoral fellows are currently working at SCBG.;  ;  In the past decades, SCBG has established extensive and productive exchange and collaboration programs with research institutions from many countries, hosting 100 international visiting scholars each year. SCBG has successfully organized 12 international conferences since 2002, including Symposium on Theory of Ecosystem Succession and Practice of Ecological Restoration, Third International Conference on Vetiver, Symposium on Theory and Methods of Carbon Equilibrium and Circulation in Ecosystems, International Symposium on Artemisia and its Allies, Second International Symposium on Family Magnoliaceae, and 23rd New Phytologist Symposium: Carbon Cycling in Tropical Ecosystems. SCBG is also the host of two international organizations Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) China Program Office and International Association of Botanical Gardens (IABG) Secretariat. In 2016, SCBG became a Patron Garden of BGCI, acting as a key partner to BGCI and helps to shape BGCI programmes of work in a mutually beneficial way. ;  ;  As a National 4A Tourist Attraction, SCBG receives about 1 million visitors per year. SCBG has paid great attention to science education to the general public with advanced knowledge produced in fields of tropical and subtropical plant research, species conservation, and sustainable resource utilization. SCBG is a National Popular Science Education Base, the Most Popular Base for Popular Science in Guangzhou, and a Patriotic Education Base.;                        Main Address:;         South China Botanical Garden, CAS;         No. 723 Xingke Road, Tianhe District;                Guangzhou;        Guangdong 510650 China;        ;                 Telephone: 0086 20 37252711;         Fax: 0086 20 37252711;         URL: www.scbg.ac.cn;         Primary Email: bgs@scbg.ac.cn       ;

9-"garden-project" style="margin-top: 1em"> Ecological restoration research in South China <!-- <img src="/files/ERABG/project_images/SouthChina2.jpg" alt="" /> --> South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SCBG), CAS carries out studies on the structure, function, mechanisms during the process of degradation and restoration of degraded ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions of China. It integrates basic research and applied studies by assessing the health status and establishing restoration models at the same time. The Garden is establishing sustainable models for degraded ecosystems such as hilly lands, coastal regions, agricultural fields and urban areas, recognizing that it is critical for the sustainable development of economy in southern China to restore the vegetation and soil of degraded ecosystems.
