-"garden-project" style="margin-top:	1em"> Ecological restoration research in South China <!-- <img src="/files/ERABG/project_images/SouthChina2.jpg" alt="" /> --> South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SCBG), CAS carries out studies on the structure, function, mechanisms during the process of degradation and restoration of degraded ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions of China. It integrates basic research and applied studies by assessing the health status and establishing restoration models at the same time. The Garden is establishing sustainable models for degraded ecosystems such as hilly lands, coastal regions, agricultural fields and urban areas, recognizing that it is critical for the sustainable development of economy in southern China to restore the vegetation and soil of degraded ecosystems.
As one of the largest comprehensive botanical gardens in China, SCBG consists of three divisions:	1) The nursery and exhibition zone. With an area of 282 ha, it was designed mainly for plant ex-situ conservation with more than 14,000 plant taxa growing in 37 special living collections, including magnolias, bamboos, palms, gingers, orchids, medicinal plants, etc.

In the past decades, SCBG has established extensive and productive exchange and collaboration programs with research institutions from many countries, hosting 100 international visiting scholars each year. SCBG has successfully organized 12 international conferences since 2002, including Symposium on Theory of Ecosystem Succession and Practice of Ecological Restoration, Third International Conference on Vetiver, Symposium on Theory and Methods of Carbon Equilibrium and Circulation in Ecosystems, International Symposium on Artemisia and its Allies, Second International Symposium on Family Magnoliaceae, and 23rd New Phytologist Symposium:	Carbon Cycling in Tropical Ecosystems. SCBG is also the host of two international organizations Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) China Program Office and International Association of Botanical Gardens (IABG) Secretariat. In 2016, SCBG became a Patron Garden of BGCI, acting as a key partner to BGCI and helps to shape BGCI programmes of work in a mutually beneficial way.
