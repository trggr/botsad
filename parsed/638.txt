This extensive and well displayed Teaching Collection contains a diversity of species that range from ancient tree ferns and cycads to a large number of economically important varieties from around the world. These excellent resources offer students the unique experience of seeing, smelling and touching living plants; learning first hand about the relationships between plant species and the evolution of plant species; climate and plant diversity; and plant adaptation to various climates and ecosystems. The ecological setting in which the plants are grown provides the basis for real life demonstrations of how organisms are connected within their environments. The botanical center operation itself allows for student internships on botancial center techniques and management.;                        Main Address:;         University of Northern Iowa Botanical Center;         Department of Biology, University of Northern Iowa;                Cedar Falls;        Iowa 50614-0421 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (319) 273-2247;         Fax: ;         URL: www.biology.uni.edu/botanicalcenter/;         Primary Email: stephanie.witte@uni.edu       ;
