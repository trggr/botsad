Henry Lyte's Nieuw Herbal - a translation from the work of a Flemish herbalist - was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth I. The property was neglected after the Lyte family left in 1748 but was rescued by Sir Walter Jenner who bought it in 1907. Sir Walter created a wonderful garden divided by clipped yew hedges, with colourful shrubs, roses and a herbaceous border. A raised walk overlooking the orchard is planted with crab apples, medlar, quince and spring bulbs. A yew-hedged walk leads to a formal pool with statues of Flora and Diana. Hornbeam tunnel leads to crescent of variegated weigela.;                        Main Address:;         Lytes Cary Manor;         Charlton Mackrell;                Somerton;        Somerset TA11 7HU United Kingdom;        ;                 Telephone: 07786661602;         Fax: ;         URL: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lytes-cary-manor/;         Primary Email:        ;
