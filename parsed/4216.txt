It covers an area of almost 3 hectares. Most of the plants in the Botanical Garden are indigenous with the exception of a few exotic plants which are of botanical or medicinal interest. A section of the garden, around a man-made ridge, is managed as a natural field garden while the rest of the garden is more intensively managed. A variety of mammals, birds, amphibians and fish made the garden their home in recent years providing a whole new dimension to the Botanical Garden.;  ;  The origin of the NWU Botanical Garden dates back to 1962 when Dr. W.J. Louw, a Botany lecturer, developed the garden to supply plant material for Botany practicals. With the arrival of  Dr. D.J. Botha in 1971, a Botany lecturer in Systematics, the impetus came to develop a Botanical Garden.  During the 1970’s the Botanical Garden flourished under the supervision of Mr. Bert Ubbink, the first horticulturalist and curator. On 24 November 1982 the Botanical Garden was officially opened by Dr. W.J. Louw.;  ;  The NWU Botanical Garden is managed by the School of Environmental Sciences and Development of the North-West University. The Botanical Garden fulfills many important functions within the School of Environmental Sciences and Development and the broader community. Key activities of the NWU Botanical Garden:;  • Provision of practical material for the training of students. ;  • Conservation of rare and endangered plants. ;  • Research and research support.;  • Education in the community about relevant environmental issues.;                        Main Address:;         North-West University Botanical Garden;         School of Environmental Sciences and Development;        North-West University;        Potchefstroom;        North West 2531 South Africa;        ;                 Telephone: +27 18 299 2753;         Fax: +27 18 299 2503;         URL: http://www.nwu.ac.za/content/botanical-garden-index-0;         Primary Email: nwubg@nwu.ac.za       ;
