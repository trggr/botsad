Embracing its southern pastoral setting through an informal, expressive design scheme, the garden is a careful blend of exuberant plant displays, bounding meadows and enduring vistas of grey green pines. Woven throughout this aesthetic tapestry are innovative research, educational programs and community outreach. The resulting union of art and scholarship is a dazzling example of the modern botanical garden.;  ;  Moore Farms Botanical Garden is wildly beautiful, creative and soulful; a place of both inspiration and comfort, where plants rule and there is a feeling of discovery, a sense of hitting upon something that others havenâ€™t.;                        Main Address:;         Moore Farms Botanical Garden;         100 New Zion Road;                Lake City;        South Carolina 29560 United States of America;        ;                 Telephone: (843) 210-7582;         Fax: ;         URL: www.moorefarmsbg.org;         Primary Email: info@moorefarmsbg.org       ;
