The idea to create a botanical garden in Mikolow-Mokre arose in 1997. In 1996 a natural resource survey was performed which showed that Mokre, a district of Mikolow, contains a unique natural environment. A wealth of habitats has survived: valuable forest stands of Fiolkowa Gora and two stream valleys: Promna and Jasienica; wetlands and farmlands with contour buffer strips (called czyznia) which are now becoming increasingly rare, limestone excavation pits, ravines and hills, and hundreds of species of plants and animals, including rare and protected ones. Overall, there is a wide array of habitats which are seldom found together within a single area. This location turned out to be perfect for the creation of a botanical garden, one that is mostly arranged by nature itself. It was therefore unnecessary to recreate natural habitats which is so often the case with botanical gardens founded within cities. In 2003 the Silesian Botanical Garden Union of Associations was founded – the entity formally responsible for the construction of the Garden. A crucial moment came in 2006, when, by a decision of the Ministry of the Environment, the Union of Associations was given permission to open the Silesian Botanical Garden. For all these years many people contributed to the creation of this place which would become the green island within the industrial and urbanized Silesia; an institution which would attempt not only to protect nature, but to be a meeting place and an environment suitable for exchanging ideas on all subjects: culture, philosophy, social issues… Finally, the idea was to create a friendly and open space for everyone who simply needs rest and a break from the fast-paced city life.;                        Main Address:;         Śląski Ogród Botaniczny w Mikołowie (Silesian Botanical Garden in Mikolow);                 ul.
