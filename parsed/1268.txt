Cuba Center        Our founders, Mr. and Mrs. Lammot du Pont Copeland, were visionary in their approach to conservation, and in their vision for Mt. Cuba Center. Mrs. Copeland summed up their ambition for Mt. Cuba Center in what has become our founding intention:;  ;  “I want this to be a place where people will learn to appreciate our native plants and to see how these plants can enrich their lives so that they, in turn, will become conservators of our natural habitats.”;  ;  Beyond the beauty of Mt. Cuba Center runs a deep river of purpose. We understand the importance of native plants and natural lands, and hope to impart that understanding to everyone who walks through our gates. It is not enough simply to observe beauty now. We must also protect it for future generations.;  ;  Our mission is to inspire an appreciation for the beauty and value of native plants and a commitment to support the habitats that sustain them.;                        Main Address:;         Mt.
