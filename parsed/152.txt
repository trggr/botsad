To;  mark the occasion, a linden tree which still grows today;  was planted there by Marshal Auguste Marmont, the first;  Governor-General of the Illyrian Provinces. The garden was;  a section of the École Centrale university college serving;  the purposes of medical studies. It was designed by Franc;  Hladnik (1773-1844), its first director. Originally it measured;  33 ares. Thanks to Hladnik and his acquaintances with;  Austrian botanists, it was not closed down after the;  French retreat and the re-establishment of Austrian rule,;  but was to become the only institution of the time to run;  uninterruptedly until the present day. Along with the;  National and University Library, the Ljubljana Botanic;  Garden is recognised as the oldest running cultural and;  educational institution in Slovenian inhabited areas.;  Franc Hladnik (1773-1844), the director of the Native;  Flora Garden until 1834, also worked as a university college;  teacher and, later, the prefect of Ljubljana Grammar;  School. As the school ranked among the Austrian lands';  best schools of the time, Hladnik was decorated by;  Emperor Franz I. During his tenure, the school's students;  included France Prešeren, who was to become the;  greatest Slovenian poet, and Hladnik is known to have;  acted on his behalf.;  Andrej Fleischmann (1804-1867) came to the Garden;  in 1819, while he was still Hladnik's student. He became;  a gardener and Hladnik's faithful companion on his;  excursions. When Hladnik's successor Ivan Nepomuk;  Biatzovski left the Garden in 1849, Fleischmann took over;  the management and remained the Garden's director until;  his death in 1867. 1843 saw the release of his important;  work Übersicht der Flora Krains (An Overview of Carniolan;  Flora).;  In 1889, Alfonz Paulin (1853-1942), who had taken over;  the management of the Ljubljana Botanic Garden only;  three years earlier, began issuing Index seminum (Seed;  Index). This led to the establishment of contacts with 78;  botanic gardens across Europe. Between 1901 and 1936;  he amassed his famous herbarium collection of Carniolan;  flora entitled Flora exsiccata Carniolica.;  In 1920, the Garden fell under the auspices of the;  University of Ljubljana, founded a year earlier. It remains;  to be a unit of the Biology Department at the Biotechnical;  Faculty of the University of Ljubljana.;  After World War II, in 1946, the Garden was expanded;  to 2.35 hectares and the first glasshouse was built on its;  site. Due to the widening of a nearby road it was later;  reduced to two hectares. A decision was taken that a new;  botanic garden should be landscaped as part of Ljubljana's;  Biological Centre at the foot of the Rožnik hill opposite the;  Zoo, but unfortunately it has not been implemented.;  In 1991, the Ljubljana Botanic Garden was protected as;  a monument of landscaped nature at the municipal level.;  As such it will continue to exist, also as part of the city's;  cultural heritage.;  The Ljubljana Botanic Garden, which contains around;  4,500 plant species from around the world, is an institution;  open to the general public. It is worth visiting at any time;  of the year. Whenever you come you will be able to find;  something interesting and attention-grabbing. But you;  may just as well take a walk of or sit about the Garden only;  to relax and enjoy landscaped natural surroundings.;                        Main Address:;         University Botanic Gardens Ljubljana;         c/o Dept. of Biology,;        Ižanska 15;        Ljubljana;        Slovenia 1000 Slovenia;        ;                 Telephone: 386 1 4271 280;         Fax: ;         URL: www.botanicni-vrt.si;         Primary Email: info@botanicni-vrt.si       ;
